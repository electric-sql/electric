 * This file defines functions to build migrations

 * To this end, we read and write files using NodeJS' `fs` module.
 * However, Electric applications do not necessarily run on NodeJS.
 * Thus, this functionality should only be used in dev mode
 * to build migrations from files using NodeJS.
 * In production, the built migrations are directly imported
 * and thus this file is not used.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Only use this file for building the migrations.
 *            Do not to import or export this file from a file
 *            that is being imported by Electric applications
 *            as NodeJS may not be present which will cause
 *            the app to crash with a require not defined error.
