-- This function augments the builtin [`session_replication_role`][1] setting to emulate its behaviour for the direct_writes mode.
--
-- With ELECTRIC_WRITE_TO_PG_MODE is set to `logical_replication`, the value of the builtin setting is looked up. On the
-- Electric->PG replication connection its value is `replica`, whereas on regular connections to Postgres it is
-- `origin`.
--
-- When ELECTRIC_WRITE_TO_PG_MODE is set to `direct_writes`, the value of the [custom `electric.session_replication_role` option][2]
-- is looked up. It is used to emulate the same Electric->PG trigger activation behaviour even though a regular connection is
-- used to apply writes to Postgres in this write mode.
