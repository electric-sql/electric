defmodule Electric.Satellite.ClientReconnectionInfo do
  @moduledoc """
  Store information related to each client that's needed for correct
  reconnection.

  ## Persistence

  Reconnection information is meant to be persistent on the same timescale as
  client reconnection is allowed. Currently, that's bounded by
  `Electric.Postgres.CachedWal` lifetime of Electric instance uptime.

  ## Stored information

  When the client reconnects, it sends two pieces of info: it's location
  in the replication stream (WAL position as a Cached WAL term) and a list
  of continued subscriptions. We need to restore sent rows graph to correctly
  process subsequent transactions.

  We store:
  1. List of subscriptions with xmin insertion points where they were sent
  2. Sent rows graph at the last ACK checkpoint
  3. Graph diffs for additional data restoration.

  Points 2 and 3 are expanded upon in the next sections

  ## Sent rows graph

  Just storing the latest graph is not enough, since the server process sees the graph
  from the point of sent rows, but when the client reconnects, it may ask to
  reconnect at a point in the past & we may need to reprocess some transactions.
  To address this, we're storing a graph at a point where the client had acknowledged
  a transaction, and if the client reconnects at some point after the checkpoint,
  we replay the transaction processing until we get to the same point.

  ## Additional data restoration and acknowledgement

  Once acknowledgement has been sent by the client we can be sure that the client wont
  try to reconnect before this ack point. We're using this to make a checkpoint, however
  it doesn't address all issues because the client can reconnect at any point after the
  ack. Since we're relying on the same "view of the world" between the server and the client,
  if there is anything sent to the client that's not recoverable from WAL itself, reconnection
  will lead to divergence.

  There are two kinds of operations that query additional data from PG to send to the client
  - initial data for a subscription or additional data for a transaction. This additional
  data has three "bad" properties: it's not already stored in WAL cache, it's shape- and
  user-specific, and it's irrecoverable without saving it. These properties mean that if a
  client has an ack point before transaction additional data, but reconnects saying that
  it had already seen additional data, we have a checkpointed sent rows graph that doesn't
  incorporate this additional data and we can query for it. This edge case leads to a
  requirement for storing this sent additional data - either in full or just as a graph diff.

  ### Example reconnection points and logic

  Consider the following operations (apart from ACK messages) that were sent in a session
  from the client (marked with `->`) and the server (unmarked).

  | N   | Op          | LSN | Graph State | Missing tx data |
  | --- | ----------- | --- | ----------- | --------------- |
  |     | -> SubReq 1 |     |             |                 |
  | 1   | SubResp 1   | 0   | 0           | {}              |
  | 2   | SubData 1   | 0   | 1 +         | {}              |
  | 3   | Tx1 +       | 1   | 2           | {1}             |
  | 4   | Tx2 +       | 2   | 3           | {1, 2}          |
  | 5   | Add Tx1     | 2   | 4 +         | {1}             |
  |     | -> SubReq 2 |     |             |                 |
  | 6   | SubResp2    | 2   | 4           | {1}             |
  | 7   | AddTx2      | 2   | 5 +         | {}              |
  | 8   | Tx3 +       | 3   | 6           | {3}             |
  | 9   | SubData 2   | 3   | 7 +         | {3}             |
  | 10  | AddTx3      | 3   | 8 +         | {}              |
  | 11  | Tx4         | 4   | 9           | {}              |

  In the table above, graph states marked with "+" had additional data added from a query,
  meaning we need to keep track of these additions until the client acknowledges them.
  If the client e.g. had sent an ack on N=4 but reconnects at N=8, then the only way
  to have the same state of the sent rows graph as the client at a point in time is
  to have stored graph state changes that incorporated additional data since the
  ack checkpoint.

  We can avoid storing entire additional data blob and go for a graph diff because
  if the client hasn't seen it yet we can just re-query postgres for that additional data.
  For example, if ack point is a N=3 and reconnection is at N=5, then we know that
  the client has never seen additional data for Tx2 - we can query it as if it's the first
  time the client is seeing this transaction.

  It's also important to store insertion points for initial subscription data: if the client
  with ack point at N=4 reconnects at N=11, when advancing checkpointed graph we need to
  correctly process Tx3 without consideration of shapes included in the second subscription.

  ### Performance tweaking

  Storing graph diff is not too bad in terms of memory, but it can get out of hand if, e.g. all
  transactions pull in large chunks of additional info. We have two mitigation mechanisms for
  this:

  1. We limit the "unacked window" - how many transactions we send to a client before we stop
     until the acknowledge what has already been received (this is stored in
     `Electric.Satellite.Protocol.OutRep`).
  2. We limit the amount of unacked additional data chunks - how many messages with subscription
     data and additional transaction data can go unacknowledged before we stop until some are.

  These tweaks allow to spend more memory for a smoother client experience on networks with
  big ping or bad upload speeds (or high-throughput setups where the server tries pushing a lot
  of transactions) - those that can't send acks quickly enough, but they also act as a
  safeguard against sending too much data to a misbehaving client. Ack messages are
  made to be as lightweight as possible while not hindering streaming speed from the server.

  ## Upon reconnection

  Client cannot reconnect before their last checkpoint - this guarantees garbage collection
  opportunity for the server. When the client reconnects with a list of subscriptions,
  we fetch the sent rows graph at the checkpoint. After that:
  1. If the client has sent less subscriptions than we established, then we clean the graph up
     as if the client unsubscribed
  2. The client sends a set of transaction IDs for which it had seen additional data.
     Any "wrong" ID in this case will be ignored. Only transactions whose data
     arrived immediately after the last acknowledged transaction matters - all
     others will be considered received because of insertion point ordering.
  3. The client sends continuation LSN
  4. Transactions are fetched from checkpoint to continuation LSN, and then applied to the
     sent rows graph. Any subscription established is applied at a point where the initial
     data was sent. Any seen additional data is cleared.
  5. If the client has seen the transaction, but not the additional data for it, then we
     redo the query for that transaction and act as if the client had just reached that txn.

  ## Implementation details

  Again, we're storing, uniquely identified by the client ID:
  1. A single checkpoint - LSN for an acknowledged transaction and a sent rows graph valid
     for this transaction.
  2. A list of fully established subscriptions with data insertion points (xmin)
  3. A set of additional data insertion points (both subscription and transaction) with
     a graph diff additional data produced. Insertion points need to have xmin and the
     insertion reason - transaction ID.
  4. A set of "actions" - structures describing a query to be executed in order to get
     additional data for a transaction - for transactions that have been acknowledged,
     but additional data for them hadn't.


  It's quite important to store only a graph diff and not a full new graph because
  ETS - what's likely to always act as a fast cache here - does full object copy on
  insert.

  Set of additional data points is read only when the client reconnects (and only up to
  reconnection point), is appended whenever the server sends or expects to send new data,
  and is cleared up to a new checkpoint when a new checkpoint is made.

  Advance stored checkpoint graph up to next acknowledged LSN.

  Once the client acknowledges a transaction, we can advance the graph, deleting the previous
  version. We may have sent additional data to the client (both as subscription data and as
  additional data for transactions), and that was stored using `store_subscription_data!/4`
  and `store_additional_txn_data!/6`. This is useful in case the client reconnects having seen
  the data - we can correctly advance the graph using both transactions and additional data.

  To accommodate a case where the client reconnects **not** having seen data for some transaction,
  we store computed "actions" - a data structure that is used to query additional data from PG.
  Those get cleared as we advance the graph and reach additional data related to that transaction
  which "fulfils" this action. Any non-cleared actions present at reconnect after advancing
  the checkpoint can be immediately used to query data the client should have seen, but got
  disconnected.

  This function should not be used directly when the client reconnects, since it doesn't do
  garbage collection based on client's state at reconnection. `advance_on_reconnection/2` should
  be used instead.
