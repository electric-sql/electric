    # this test has to be carefully crafted to work around the limitations of my simplistic tree
    # structure and my simplistic scope path algo.
    #
    # in reality this test isn't really excercising anything that isn't touched in the main
    # permissions test. crucially the ability of the rider in this to read the address is
    # determined by the existence of their role on the correct orders scope.  them not being
    # "assigned" to the order does not affect their perms, it is the presence of this role
    # exclusively (since the address in question is always in the given scope, no matter what the
    # status of the rider).
    #
    # so the functioning (or not) of this test would depend, in the real world, on the correct
    # behaviour of the assigns triggers creating and removing the rider's role.
    #
    # with all that said, I'm leaving this here because we might need to model the more complex
    # data structure it includes.
