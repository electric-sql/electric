# @electric-ax/agents-server-conformance-tests

## 0.1.12

### Patch Changes

- baee54e: Increase agent tool call timeouts to a 2-minute default with a 10-minute maximum, and allow bash calls to request longer timeouts per command.
- 50e93c2: Add editable session titles: a `set_title` tool for Horton, click-to-edit UI in EntityHeader, and txid propagation for tag/send/inbox mutations so clients can await sync consistency.
- Updated dependencies [b8875a2]
  - @electric-sql/client@1.5.21

## 0.1.11

### Patch Changes

- d14d9a9: Remove the unused per-entity agents error stream. Entities now expose only their main stream; spawn, fork, registry lookup, terminal signal handling, UI/runtime types, client helpers, and conformance tests no longer create or require an entity-level error stream.

## 0.1.10

### Patch Changes

- 17b374f: Adds the `Sandbox` primitive (`@electric-ax/agents-runtime/sandbox`) for isolating LLM-driven tool calls. Three providers ship: `unrestrictedSandbox()` (explicit pass-through), `remoteSandbox({provider: 'e2b'})` (E2B as an optional peer dep), and `dockerSandbox()` (container isolation via `dockerode` as an optional peer dep).

  Built-in entities (Horton, Worker) default to `unrestrictedSandbox` via the new `chooseDefaultSandbox(workingDirectory)` helper. Stronger isolation is opt-in by constructing `dockerSandbox` or `remoteSandbox` directly — `dockerSandbox` is the recommended path for multi-entity hosting.

  Behavior changes folded in: bash no longer forwards `process.env` to children (removes the trivial `env`-dump leak of secrets like `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — note the host-sharing `unrestricted` provider still can't fully contain secrets, e.g. via `/proc/<ppid>/environ`, so use `docker`/`remote` for untrusted or multi-tenant entities), tool descriptions corrected, and read/write/edit reject symlink escapes from the workspace.

  Runtimes advertise named **sandbox profiles** (e.g. `local`, `docker`) to the agents-server; spawn requests pick a profile by name, the server validates the choice against the target runner's advertised set, and the new-session UI surfaces a picker. Internally, the built-in tool factories (`createBashTool`, `createFetchUrlTool`, etc.) now route their filesystem and network access through the active `Sandbox`.

- d5708c7: Bump `@durable-streams/{client,server,state}` pins in step with `@electric-ax/agents-runtime` and `@electric-ax/agents-server` to pick up the fork-at-pointer (`Stream-Fork-Offset` + `Stream-Fork-Sub-Offset`) wire protocol that the new fork-at-message UX depends on. No other code changes in these packages.

## 0.1.9

### Patch Changes

- 98b51d6: Update Electric Agents packages to depend on the stable Durable Streams
  packages instead of pkg.pr builds. This pulls in `@durable-streams/client`
  0.2.6, `@durable-streams/server` 0.3.5, and `@durable-streams/state` 0.2.9.
  Examples now resolve `@electric-ax/agents-runtime` from the workspace so they
  do not keep older registry runtime builds pinned in the lockfile.

## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- d344c32: Treat Electric Agents server URLs as opaque tenant-scoped base URLs rooted at `/t/<tenant-id>/v1`, migrate desktop and mobile Cloud clients to that URL shape, move observation stream ensure endpoints under `/_electric/observations/*/ensure-stream`, rename the pre-alpha entity/cron/schema/tag/docs APIs to their Electric Agents names, add a non-interactive `electric agents view` transcript command, and make Horton title extraction work with lightweight desktop inbox collection facades.

  Send the done callback for completed wake checkpoints during graceful shutdown, preventing desktop reloads from leaving already completed DS subscription claims pending.

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- e13cad1: Add durable entity signals and signal-driven stop controls for agents. The server, runtime, conformance tests, and CLI now use signal APIs, persist signal events, and let the UI send `SIGINT` to cancel active generations with pending stop feedback.
- 4d9c36e: Add a fine-grained reactive entity timeline query and migrate the agents UI to use it. Timeline rows are maintained by TanStack DB using multi-source queries and live child collections, so streamed agent responses update incrementally without rematerializing the whole chat timeline. Update the mobile app to consume the row-based timeline shape and pin React to the React Native renderer version. Keep the conformance property-test model aligned with generated entity type names.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 99ac6fd: Pin Durable Streams dependencies to commit `5d5c217` so local development resolves the same subscription-control routing code as the PR build.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 47f17f1: Route Durable Streams subscription control traffic through the reserved `__ds` prefix under each stream URL. Agents-server now accepts control routes at the server-root `__ds` prefix, proxies them before normal stream operations, and forwards Durable Streams requests through the resolved tenant stream root instead of inferring cloud-specific URL shapes.
- Updated dependencies [a15c7b6]
  - @electric-sql/client@1.5.18

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- dfc9a45: Combine the desktop app packaging setup, app settings, and agents UI improvements. Adds desktop packaging assets/configuration, multi-server desktop settings, improved chat and workspace UI behavior, and queued inbox message modes in the runtime.
- 83204d9: Add principals support to the agents system. Every API request now carries a `Principal` (user, agent, service, or system) threaded through the full request lifecycle. Runner dispatch is scoped to the authenticated owner via dispatch policy authorization. The runtime exposes `ctx.principal` in handler context so agent code can implement principal-aware logic. The server UI uses asserted identity headers for dev-mode authentication.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 443482a: Prepare the agents server and server conformance test packages for public npm publication.

  The agents server package now publishes its Drizzle migration files alongside the built entrypoints so installed servers can run database migrations outside the monorepo.

- 08e85a0: Refactor agents-server HTTP routing around a single `globalRouter` entrypoint passed a flat `TenantContext`.

  The `ElectricAgentsServer` class now owns lifecycle setup only and dispatches each request through an OSS-only wrapper router that layers dashboard and mock-agent routes over `globalRouter.fetch(request, tenantContext)`. This prepares the exported `globalRouter` for library-mode use by callers that build tenant context outside the OSS server class without pulling in the bundled UI or mock agent.

  Breaking change: entity RPC URLs moved from `/:type/:instanceId/...` to `/_electric/entities/:type/:instanceId/...`. This affects entity spawn/get/head/delete, send, fork, tag, and schedule endpoints. The root namespace is now durable-streams pass-through, with no reserved entity control routes.

  Breaking change: the `@electric-ax/agents-server` package root now only exports the library-mode routing assembly surface: DB setup helpers, `AgentsHost`, `StreamClient`, `globalRouter`, `TenantContext`, `GlobalRoutes`, `EntityBridgeCoordinator`, and tenant helpers. OSS server classes, subrouters, entity-manager internals, scheduler/wake-registry internals, schema helpers, and entity response helpers are no longer root exports.

  The runtime server client, bundled agents-server UI, and conformance tests have been updated for the new route layout. Agents-server control-plane routes now use shared TypeBox/Ajv body validation.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 744c47f: Replace static entity write tokens with claim-scoped tokens. Write tokens are now issued when a consumer claims a wake and revoked on done, preventing leaked credentials from granting permanent write access. Removes `writeToken` from webhook notifications and spawn response headers.
- Updated dependencies [92a332e]
  - @electric-sql/client@1.5.17

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- e0b588f: Bump `@electric-ax/durable-streams-*-beta` dependencies to the latest published versions (`client@^0.3.1`, `state@^0.3.1`, `server@^0.3.2`).
