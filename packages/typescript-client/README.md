# TypeScript client for ElectricSQL

Real-time Postgres sync for modern apps.

Electric provides an [HTTP interface](https://electric-sql.com/docs/api/http) to Postgres to enable a massive number of clients to query and get real-time updates to subsets of the database, called [Shapes](https://electric-sql.com//docs/guides/shapes). In this way, Electric turns Postgres into a real-time database.

The TypeScript client helps ease reading Shapes from the HTTP API in the browser and other JavaScript environments, such as edge functions and server-side Node/Bun/Deno applications. It supports both fine-grained and coarse-grained reactivity patterns &mdash; you can subscribe to see every row that changes, or you can just subscribe to get the whole shape whenever it changes.

## Install

The client is published on NPM as [`@electric-sql/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@electric-sql/client):

```sh
npm i @electric-sql/client
```

## How to use

The client exports a `ShapeStream` class for getting updates to shapes on a row-by-row basis as well as a `Shape` class for getting updates to the entire shape.

### `ShapeStream`

```tsx
import { ShapeStream } from '@electric-sql/client'

// Passes subscribers rows as they're inserted, updated, or deleted
const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: `${BASE_URL}/v1/shape`,
  table: `foo`,
})

stream.subscribe(messages => {
  // messages is an array with one or more row updates
  // and the stream will wait for all subscribers to process them
  // before proceeding
})
```

### `Shape`

```tsx
import { ShapeStream, Shape } from '@electric-sql/client'

const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: `${BASE_URL}/v1/shape`,
  table: `foo`,
})
const shape = new Shape(stream)

// Returns promise that resolves with the latest shape data once it's fully loaded
await shape.rows

// passes subscribers shape data when the shape updates
shape.subscribe(({ rows }) => {
  // rows is an array of the latest value of each row in a shape.
}
```
