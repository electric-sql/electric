## 1.5.7

### Patch Changes

- ca931d9: Fix BigInt values in subset loading parameters causing `JSON.stringify` to throw "Do not know how to serialize a BigInt". Values from parsed int8 columns can now be passed directly as `requestSnapshot`/`fetchSnapshot` params without manual conversion.
- 858e13d: Fix on-demand mode (`offset: "now"`) to advance the stream's offset/handle after a cold-start `requestSnapshot()`, so the stream resumes from the snapshot's position rather than the stale `"now"` offset. Prevents updates committed between the snapshot and the stream's next live poll from being missed.

## 1.5.6

### Patch Changes

- 4c7855b: Fix prefetch buffer incorrectly serving cached GET responses to POST subset/snapshot requests that share the same URL, which could route stream chunks into the subset handler.
- c84d985: Fix handling of deprecated 204 responses from old Electric servers. Previously, a 204 ("no content, you're caught up") only updated `lastSyncedAt` but never transitioned to the live state, so `isUpToDate` stayed false, `live=true` was never added to the URL, and subscribers waiting for the up-to-date signal were never notified. The bug is inert with current servers (which never send 204) but would cause an infinite catch-up polling loop against older servers.

## 1.5.5

### Patch Changes

- e9bc504: Fix `TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator` crash when a proxy or CDN returns a non-array JSON response from the shape endpoint. Add null-safety to message type guards and throw a proper `FetchError` for non-array responses so the existing retry/backoff infrastructure handles it.

## 1.5.4

### Patch Changes

- 186b8f8: Properly bundle `fetch-event-source`, so consumer use patched version.

  When liveSse mode got introduced, it included `fetch-event-source` which is used instead of built-in `EventSource` because of richer capabilities. However, it had a few assumptions (document/window existence) + bugs, when it comes to aborting. This was patched, however, when building `typescript-client` patched version isn't included and when user uses it - they have unpatched version.

## 1.5.3

### Patch Changes

- 9698b03: Add PauseLock to coordinate pause/resume across visibility changes and snapshot requests, preventing race conditions where one subsystem's resume could override another's pause.
- b0cbe75: Fix crash when receiving a stale cached response on a resumed session with no schema yet. When the client resumes from a persisted handle/offset, the schema starts undefined. If the first response is stale (expired handle from a misconfigured CDN), the response is ignored and body parsing is skipped — but the code then accesses `schema!`, which is still undefined, causing a parse error. Now the client skips body parsing entirely for ignored stale responses.
- b0cbe75: Refactor ShapeStream's implicit sync state into an explicit state machine using the OOP state pattern. Each state (Initial, Syncing, Live, Replaying, StaleRetry, Paused, Error) is a separate class carrying only its relevant fields, with transitions producing new immutable state objects. This replaces the previous flat context bag where all fields existed simultaneously regardless of the current state.
- b0cbe75: Fix infinite loop when the client resumes with a persisted handle that matches an expired handle. The stale cache detection assumed that having a local handle meant it was different from the expired one, so it returned "ignored" instead of retrying with a cache buster. When `localHandle === expiredHandle`, the client would loop forever: fetch stale response, ignore it, retry without cache buster, get the same stale response. Now the client correctly enters stale-retry with a cache buster when its own handle is the expired one.

## 1.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 091a232: Fix ShapeStream hanging after system sleep in non-browser environments (Bun, Node.js). Stale in-flight HTTP requests are now automatically aborted and reconnected on wake, preventing hangs until TCP timeout.

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 42aee8a: Fix 409 must-refetch error handling in fetchSnapshot. The method now correctly catches FetchError exceptions thrown by the fetch wrapper chain, matching the pattern used by the main request loop.
- fef494e: Fix stale CDN response incorrectly updating client offset. When a CDN returns a cached response with an expired shape handle, the client now ignores the entire response (including offset) to prevent handle/offset mismatch that would cause server errors.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 3f257aa: Add POST support for subset snapshots to avoid URL length limits. Clients can now send subset parameters (WHERE clauses, ordering, pagination) in the request body instead of URL query parameters, preventing HTTP 414 errors with complex queries or large IN lists.

## 1.4.2

### Patch Changes

- a428324: Fix infinite loop in replay mode when CDN returns the same cursor repeatedly. The client now exits replay mode after the first suppressed up-to-date notification, preventing the loop while still correctly suppressing duplicate notifications from cached responses.

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 6d6e199: Fix infinite loop when response is missing required headers

  When the server returns 200 OK but with missing required headers (like `electric-cursor`), the client would enter an infinite retry loop if `onError` returned `{}`. Now `MissingHeadersError` is treated as non-retryable since it's a configuration issue that won't self-heal.

- 594afee: Fix stale cached responses with expired shape handles

  When a CDN/proxy is misconfigured and serves a stale cached response with an expired shape handle, the client would get into a broken state where the handle was rejected but the offset was still advanced. This fix detects stale responses and triggers a retry with a cache buster parameter to bypass the misconfigured CDN cache.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 78fc0ae: Add structured subset params support (whereExpr, orderByExpr) to enable proper columnMapper transformations for subset queries. When TanStack DB sends structured expression data alongside compiled SQL strings, the client can now apply column name transformations (e.g., camelCase to snake_case) before generating the final SQL.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- f6e7c75: Fix infinite 409 loop when proxy returns stale cached response with expired shape handle.

  **Root cause:** When a 409 response arrives, the client marks the old handle as expired and fetches with a new handle. If a proxy ignores the `expired_handle` cache buster parameter and returns a stale cached response containing the old handle, the client would accept it and enter an infinite 409 loop.

  **The fix:**

  - In `#onInitialResponse`: Don't accept a shape handle from the response if it matches the expired handle in the expired shapes cache
  - In `getNextChunkUrl` (prefetch): Don't prefetch the next chunk if the response handle equals the `expired_handle` from the request URL
  - Added console warnings when this situation is detected to help developers debug proxy misconfigurations

  This provides defense-in-depth against misconfigured proxies that don't include all query parameters in their cache keys.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ed98c6b: feat: denote end of injected subset snapshot with an additional message

### Patch Changes

- 8fd8c8f: Fix memory leak from recursive async functions by upgrading TypeScript target to ES2017.

  The ES2016 target caused async/await to be transpiled using the `__async` helper which creates nested Promise chains that cannot be garbage collected when recursive async functions like `requestShape()` call themselves. With ES2017+, native async/await is used which doesn't have this issue.

- 5ab082b: Fix stream stopping after tab visibility changes due to stale aborted requests in PrefetchQueue.

  **Root cause:** When a page is hidden, the stream pauses and aborts in-flight prefetch requests. The aborted promises remained in the PrefetchQueue's internal Map. When the page became visible and the stream resumed, `consume()` returned the stale aborted promise, causing an AbortError to propagate to ShapeStream and stop syncing.

  **The fix:**

  - `PrefetchQueue.consume()` now checks if the request's abort signal is already aborted before returning it
  - `PrefetchQueue.abort()` now clears the internal map after aborting controllers
  - The fetch wrapper clears `prefetchQueue` after calling `abort()` to ensure fresh requests

  Fixes #3460

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- c8ad84a: Fix columnMapper to support loading subsets. When using `columnMapper` with ShapeStream, the `columns` parameter is now properly encoded from application column names (e.g., camelCase) to database column names (e.g., snake_case) before transmission to the server.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- a302f66: feat: add support for subqueries without invalidation
- 3f3c078: Add SSE-related headers to client requests

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 18df5a5: Add bidirectional column mapping API for query filters with built-in snake_case ↔ camelCase support. Introduces `columnMapper` option to `ShapeStream` that handles both encoding (TypeScript → Database) for WHERE clauses and decoding (Database → TypeScript) for results. Includes `snakeCamelMapper()` helper for automatic snake_case/camelCase conversion and `createColumnMapper()` for custom mappings. The new API deprecates using `transformer` solely for column renaming, though `transformer` remains useful for value transformations like encryption.

### Patch Changes

- f0b83fa: Fix subset\_\_params to use constant parameter name for proxy configurations

  Changed subset**params from deepObject style (subset**params[1], subset**params[2]) to JSON serialization (subset**params={"1":"value1","2":"value2"}). This allows proxy configurations to match the constant parameter name "subset\_\_params" in ELECTRIC_PROTOCOL_QUERY_PARAMS without needing dynamic pattern matching.

- cd15a56: Fix multiple renders from cached up-to-date messages on page refresh. When a shape receives multiple updates within the HTTP cache window (60s), each update ends with an up-to-date control message that gets cached. On page refresh, these cached responses replay rapidly, causing multiple renders. This change implements cursor-based detection to suppress cached up-to-date notifications until a fresh response (with a new cursor) arrives from the server, ensuring only one render occurs.

## 1.1.5

### Patch Changes

- aacfba4: Expose the ShapeStream.fetchSnapshot as a public api that can be used to fetch a snapshot without it being injected into the emitted stream of change messages. This is useful for cases where the user wants to handle the application of these snapshot in a custom way.

## 1.1.4

### Patch Changes

- b377010: Fix race condition where collections get stuck and stop reconnecting after rapid tab switching, particularly in Firefox.

  **Root cause:** Two race conditions in the pause/resume state machine:

  1. `#resume()` only checked for `paused` state, but `#pause()` sets an intermediate `pause-requested` state. When visibility changes rapidly, `#resume()` is called before the abort completes, leaving the stream stuck.
  2. Stale abort completions could overwrite the `active` state after `#resume()` has already started a new request.

  **State machine flow:**

  ```
  Normal pause:
    active → pause() → pause-requested → abort completes → paused

  Interrupted pause (rapid tab switch):
    active → pause() → pause-requested → resume() → active
             ↑                              ↑
             abort starts              resumes immediately,
                                       prevents stuck state
  ```

  **Additional fix:** Memory leak where visibility change event listeners were never removed, causing listener accumulation and potential interference from stale handlers.

## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 5c24974: add `live_sse` to ELECTRIC_PROTOCOL_QUERY_PARAMS

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- e4f2c4d: Fix duplicate operations being emitted after error recovery with `onError` handler. When the `onError` handler returned new params/headers to retry after an error (e.g., 401), the stream was resetting its offset and refetching all data from the beginning, causing duplicate insert operations and "already exists" errors in collections. The stream now correctly preserves its offset during error recovery and continues from where it left off.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- ff36103: fix: ensure retry-after header is present on errors while stack is starting up

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 37242f6: Deprecate `experimental_live_sse` and introduce proper `live_sse` flag for sending live updates as server sent events.

### Patch Changes

- 37242f6: Handle 409 must refetch message from both SSE and long poll fetches correctly.
- a328418: Ensure `FetchBackoffAbortError` is emitted even if aborting while request body is being streamed.

## 1.0.13

### Patch Changes

- 47cda20: Add optional `shardSubdomain` shape option to auto-shard the url subdomain in development. This solves the slow shapes in development problem without needing HTTP/2 or system level deps like Caddy or mkcert.

## 1.0.12

### Patch Changes

- d87b6ec: fix: rename the `log` property

## 1.0.11

### Patch Changes

- aa48e04: feat: add a `snapshot-end` control message to the end of snapshots
- 965ef47: feat: add support for `changes_only` mode, subset snapshots, and `offset=now`
  - `changes_only` - in this mode the server will not create initial snapshot for the shape, the clients will start receiving changes without seeing base data. Best paired with...
  - Subset snapshots - the server now accepts a `subset__*` set of parameters, which when provided result in a special-form response containing a snapshot of a subset (may be full) of a shape, and information on how to position this response in the stream. The client exposes a new method `requestSnapshot` which will make this request and then inject the response into the correct place in the subscribed messages stream, bounded with a `snapshot-end` control message.
  - `offset=now` - the server now accepts a `offset=now` special value, in which case the client will receive an immediate up-to-date response with the latest possible continuation offset, allowing it to skip all historical data and start "from scratch". This works best with `changes_only` and subset snapshots where a client doesn't keep state and upon a reload needs to start fresh without historical data.

## 1.0.10

### Patch Changes

- 9be7751: Add `transformer` function to `ShapeStreamOptions` to support transforms like camelCase keys.
- 64dcfec: Add client-side cache buster for expired shapes to prevent 409s

  When a shape 409s, the client now stores this information in localStorage and adds a `expired_handle` parameter to future requests for that shape, preventing redundant 409 responses and reducing app loading latency.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 9c50e8f: [BREAKING]: Remove databaseId option from ShapeStream in favor of params option.
- e96928e: [BREAKING]: Move non-protocol options like table & where to the params sub-key

  ## Context

  Electric's TypeScript client is currently tightly coupled to PostgreSQL-specific options in its `ShapeStreamOptions` interface. As Electric plans to support multiple data sources in the future, we need to separate protocol-level options from source-specific options.

  ## Changes

  1. Created a new `PostgresParams` type to define PostgreSQL-specific parameters:
     - `table`: The root table for the shape
     - `where`: Where clauses for the shape
     - `columns`: Columns to include in the shape
     - `replica`: Whether to send full or partial row updates
  2. Moved PostgreSQL-specific options from the top-level `ShapeStreamOptions` interface to the `params` sub-key
  3. Updated `ParamsRecord` type to include PostgreSQL parameters
  4. Updated the `ShapeStream` class to handle parameters from the `params` object
  5. Updated documentation to reflect the changes

  ## Migration Example

  Before:

  ```typescript
  const stream = new ShapeStream({
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/v1/shape',
    table: 'users',
    where: 'id > 100',
    columns: ['id', 'name'],
    replica: 'full',
  })
  ```

  After:

  ```typescript
  const stream = new ShapeStream({
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/v1/shape',
    params: {
      table: 'users',
      where: 'id > 100',
      columns: ['id', 'name'],
      replica: 'full',
    },
  })
  ```
