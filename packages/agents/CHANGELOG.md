# @electric-ax/agents

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- dec65ae: Port pull-wake runners onto the tenant-aware agents-server routing refactor.

  Agents-server now supports runner registration, runner-owned pull-wake subscriptions, dispatch policy resolution, subscription stream linking, compact Durable Streams wake claims, callback-forward claim lifecycle handling, and claim-scoped write tokens. Runtime built-ins can register pull-wake runners, tail runner wake streams, claim work through the server, heartbeat offsets, and acknowledge completed work. The CLI, desktop integration, server UI, and local full-stack compose setup now use runner-backed local sessions for the pull-wake flow.

  Saved agents-server connections can include additional request headers for tenant-aware deployments, and CLI/runtime URL handling now preserves base query parameters such as `?secret=...`.

### Patch Changes

- dec65ae: Do not register a built-in pull-wake runner as the default dispatch policy for built-in agent entity types.
- 08e85a0: Refactor agents-server HTTP routing around a single `globalRouter` entrypoint passed a flat `TenantContext`.

  The `ElectricAgentsServer` class now owns lifecycle setup only and dispatches each request through an OSS-only wrapper router that layers dashboard and mock-agent routes over `globalRouter.fetch(request, tenantContext)`. This prepares the exported `globalRouter` for library-mode use by callers that build tenant context outside the OSS server class without pulling in the bundled UI or mock agent.

  Breaking change: entity RPC URLs moved from `/:type/:instanceId/...` to `/_electric/entities/:type/:instanceId/...`. This affects entity spawn/get/head/delete, send, fork, tag, and schedule endpoints. The root namespace is now durable-streams pass-through, with no reserved entity control routes.

  Breaking change: the `@electric-ax/agents-server` package root now only exports the library-mode routing assembly surface: DB setup helpers, `AgentsHost`, `StreamClient`, `globalRouter`, `TenantContext`, `GlobalRoutes`, `EntityBridgeCoordinator`, and tenant helpers. OSS server classes, subrouters, entity-manager internals, scheduler/wake-registry internals, schema helpers, and entity response helpers are no longer root exports.

  The runtime server client, bundled agents-server UI, and conformance tests have been updated for the new route layout. Agents-server control-plane routes now use shared TypeBox/Ajv body validation.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1df7cce: Add Model Context Protocol (MCP) support — agents can call tools, read resources, and use prompts from external MCP servers (stdio + Streamable HTTP), with OAuth handled by the runtime. New `@electric-ax/agents-mcp` package ships the `Registry` API, transports, OAuth bridges, and opt-in `keychainPersistence` / `filePersistence` helpers. The Electron desktop app exposes a Settings → MCP Servers page and a `mcp.servers` block in `settings.json` that layers with the per-workspace `mcp.json`. Built-in `horton` and `worker` agents see registered MCP tools transparently via `mcp.tools()`.

### Patch Changes

- 65f0cf0: Add `openai-codex` as a built-in model provider. When the user has logged into OpenAI Codex CLI (`~/.codex/auth.json` exists), GPT-5.x models automatically appear in the dashboard model dropdown with reasoning effort support.
- f509387: Allow Horton and Worker to use configured Anthropic or OpenAI models. Adds a `model-catalog` that selects providers from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`, surfaces UI-selectable reasoning effort for compatible OpenAI reasoning models, and threads the catalog through `bootstrap`, `registerHorton`, `registerWorker`, and `spawnWorker`.
- 590aabb: Improve the agents UI timeline and reactivity, add a browser-safe runtime client export, and route built-in agent metadata extraction through the configurable low-cost model runner.
- 28d127b: Electron desktop shell, tile-based workspace, and per-session
  working-directory picker.
  - `@electric-ax/agents-desktop`: new package — Electron app
    bundling a local Horton runtime, system-tray status, multi-
    window support, frameless windows with in-app title bars,
    native menus, About dialog, on-launch API key prompt
    (Anthropic / OpenAI / Brave), localhost agent-server discovery,
    and HMR via `vite-plugin-electron`.
  - `@electric-ax/agents-server`: entrypoint support for the local
    desktop runtime wiring.
  - `@electric-ax/agents-server-ui`: tile-based workspace (DnD,
    splits, persisted layouts, shareable URLs), redesigned new-
    session screen, refreshed dropdown chrome (`Combobox`
    primitive, sentence-case section headings, ServerPicker-style
    rows), sidebar filter & view menu with grouping by date /
    type / status / working dir, full Settings screen with
    General / Appearance / Local Runtime categories.
  - `@electric-ax/agents`: Horton accepts an optional
    `workingDirectory` spawn arg so each session can run against
    its own project root without restarting the runtime.
  - `@electric-ax/agents-runtime`: tool-pair preservation during
    compaction and matching tool-call events by id (bug fixes
    surfaced while building the desktop UI).
  - `@electric-sql/experimental`, `@electric-sql/react`: align test
    type configuration with DOM AbortSignal types used by the client.

- a3cee92: Remove the coder entity (coding-session). The `registerCodingSession`, `useCodingAgent`, `CodingSessionHandle`, and related types/tools (`spawn_coder`, `prompt_coder`) are no longer available. The `agent-session-protocol` dependency is also removed.
- 7f8947a: Require low-cost model calls to provide an explicit system prompt and add prompts for URL extraction and skill metadata extraction.

- Updated dependencies [1cb5020]
  - @electric-ax/agents-runtime@0.1.2

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 4d8e452: Bundle Electric Agents documentation with the package so Horton can search docs without an external docs directory. Copies 39 markdown files from the docs site into `packages/agents/docs/` and updates `resolveDocsRoot` to find them relative to the module directory in both development and production builds.
- b0af010: Fix chat starter typing indicator: inline multiple agent names in a single line and use useChat state for reliable detection.
- b0af010: Redesign quickstart tutorial: replace chatroom steps with perspectives analyzer UI, add scaffold-based frontend with Radix Themes and Streamdown markdown, improve Horton prompt for docs search priority, add checkpoint with multiple paths after entity-building steps.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 125c276: Improve Horton's onboarding: add warm greeting for initial messages and present multiple onboarding paths instead of defaulting to the quickstart skill.
- e0b588f: Bump `@electric-ax/durable-streams-*-beta` dependencies to the latest published versions (`client@^0.3.1`, `state@^0.3.1`, `server@^0.3.2`).
- Updated dependencies [e0b588f]
  - @electric-ax/agents-runtime@0.1.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 491ba04: Move tool implementations (bash, read, write, edit, fetch_url, web_search, schedules) from agents-server to agents package, removing duplicate code. Tools are now exported from `@electric-ax/agents`.
- 4fc022b: Redesign Horton onboarding: rename tutorial to quickstart skill (extended with routes + frontend phases), add init skill for project scaffolding, add onboarding routing to system prompt, configurable docs URL via HORTON_DOCS_URL, upgrade to claude-sonnet-4-6, fix web search fallback tool definition, and remove duplicate braveSearchTool from agents-server (now exported from agents)
- 4987694: Move tool implementations (bash, read, write, edit, fetch_url, web_search, schedules) from `@electric-ax/agents` to `@electric-ax/agents-runtime` so they are available without importing the built-in agents package. **Breaking:** tool exports removed from `@electric-ax/agents` — import from `@electric-ax/agents-runtime` instead.

### Patch Changes

- 89debcf: Add the `coder` entity (a Claude Code / Codex CLI session wrapped as a long-lived entity) and give Horton matching `spawn_coder` / `prompt_coder` tools so the chatbot can dispatch coding work and keep prompting the same coder across many turns. The coder records its own `runs` events around each CLI invocation and pipes the assistant reply through `attachResponse`, so observers waking with `runFinished` get the response in the wake payload. Includes `--skip-git-repo-check` for `codex exec`, deterministic per-cwd Claude session discovery (so non-interactive `claude -p` runs are found reliably), and adopts the first prompt's text as the entity's display title.
