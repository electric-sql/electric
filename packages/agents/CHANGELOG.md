### Patch Changes

- 9c275b7: Add `send` tool exposing `ctx.send()` to LLM agents (Horton and Worker) for sending messages to Electric entities by URL. Change `send()` return type from `void` to `Promise<SendResult>` so callers can await delivery confirmation and handle failures with structured error results.
- 99ac6fd: Pin Durable Streams dependencies to commit `5d5c217` so local development resolves the same subscription-control routing code as the PR build.
- adc99e9: Move the `.md`-skill-directory loader (`createSkillsRegistry`) and the per-entity skill tool builder (`createSkillTools`) — together with the `SkillsRegistry` / `SkillMeta` types and the underlying `preamble` / `extract-meta` helpers — out of `@electric-ax/agents` and into `@electric-ax/agents-runtime`, alongside the rest of the entity-runtime primitives.

  No behaviour change. Same files, re-rooted to the package whose dependencies they already use: skills depend on `completeWithLowCostModel` and the runtime logger, both already in `agents-runtime`. The skills code uses zero symbols defined in `@electric-ax/agents`, so the previous arrangement had the dependency graph pointing the wrong way.

  This makes the skills primitives available to any package built on top of `agents-runtime` (e.g. external Discord / Slack / CLI bots) without pulling in Horton, Worker, or `BuiltinAgentsServer` as transitive context.

  Existing internal call sites in `@electric-ax/agents` (`bootstrap.ts`, `agents/horton.ts`) now import from `@electric-ax/agents-runtime`. No public API of `@electric-ax/agents` is affected — the skills surface was never re-exported from its `index.ts`, so embedders that only consumed Horton / Worker / Server APIs continue to work unchanged.

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- e126eba: Harden pull-wake runner lifecycle with a state machine, heartbeat-driven stream resets, and exponential reconnect backoff (1s-30s). Add granular `status` field to `PullWakeRunnerHealth` (`stopped | starting | connecting | streaming | reconnecting | stopping`). The `onError` callback is now reporting-only (`(Error) => void`) - it can no longer control runner lifecycle. `stop()` rethrows `drainWakes` errors so callers observe wake handler failures. Event-driven heartbeat throttling avoids stale diagnostics between fixed-interval heartbeats. Durable Streams clients now append stream and `__ds` subscription control paths to the configured backend URL prefix without inferring a `/v1/stream` layout, so pull-wake subscriptions work behind arbitrary DS backend prefixes. Remove the stale `StreamClient.getConsumerState()` helper for the old Durable Streams `/consumers` endpoint.
- e126eba: Add pull-wake runner health check endpoint and rename `owner_user_id` to `owner_principal` across the runners system. The `GET /_electric/runners/:id/health` endpoint returns comprehensive diagnostics including runner state, client-reported stream/heartbeat/claim metrics, active claims, and dispatch stats with a derived health status (healthy/degraded/unhealthy). The `PullWakeRunner` now tracks internal diagnostics and reports them to the server via heartbeats, stored in a separate `runner_runtime_diagnostics` table so the main `runners` shape stays stable for normal UI sync. The `owner_user_id` → `owner_principal` rename stores canonical principal URLs instead of keys, with strict validation and canonicalization at route boundaries. The migration expires active runner claims and deletes existing runner rows as part of the principal rewrite. This is a breaking change with no backward compatibility — all callers must send principal URLs.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- c4e046f: Add Electric Cloud sign-in to the desktop app. New Settings → Account panel signs in via GitHub or Google through `dashboard.electric-sql.cloud`'s loopback OAuth flow (the same one the CLI uses), encrypts the resulting JWT with `safeStorage`, refreshes name + workspaces via `auth.whoami`, and offers a one-click jump to the user's Electric Cloud dashboard.

  Add first-launch onboarding for Electric Cloud sign-in and LLM API keys, plus a Cloud Agent Servers settings section that syncs the user's Cloud agent servers, mints per-tenant agents tokens in the main process, and connects the desktop runtime/UI to tenant-scoped Cloud agents URLs without exposing those tokens to the renderer or `settings.json`.

- 21ad820: Harden Electric Agents remote error reporting and add optional `ELECTRIC_AGENTS_PRINCIPAL` support for principal-aware servers.
- 0e72995: Move spawn worker tool instructions from system prompt to initial message for better worker briefing

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- dfc9a45: Combine the desktop app packaging setup, app settings, and agents UI improvements. Adds desktop packaging assets/configuration, multi-server desktop settings, improved chat and workspace UI behavior, and queued inbox message modes in the runtime.
- 83204d9: Add principals support to the agents system. Every API request now carries a `Principal` (user, agent, service, or system) threaded through the full request lifecycle. Runner dispatch is scoped to the authenticated owner via dispatch policy authorization. The runtime exposes `ctx.principal` in handler context so agent code can implement principal-aware logic. The server UI uses asserted identity headers for dev-mode authentication.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- dec65ae: Port pull-wake runners onto the tenant-aware agents-server routing refactor.

  Agents-server now supports runner registration, runner-owned pull-wake subscriptions, dispatch policy resolution, subscription stream linking, compact Durable Streams wake claims, callback-forward claim lifecycle handling, and claim-scoped write tokens. Runtime built-ins can register pull-wake runners, tail runner wake streams, claim work through the server, heartbeat offsets, and acknowledge completed work. The CLI, desktop integration, server UI, and local full-stack compose setup now use runner-backed local sessions for the pull-wake flow.

  Saved agents-server connections can include additional request headers for tenant-aware deployments, and CLI/runtime URL handling now preserves base query parameters such as `?secret=...`.

### Patch Changes

- dec65ae: Do not register a built-in pull-wake runner as the default dispatch policy for built-in agent entity types.
- 08e85a0: Refactor agents-server HTTP routing around a single `globalRouter` entrypoint passed a flat `TenantContext`.

  The `ElectricAgentsServer` class now owns lifecycle setup only and dispatches each request through an OSS-only wrapper router that layers dashboard and mock-agent routes over `globalRouter.fetch(request, tenantContext)`. This prepares the exported `globalRouter` for library-mode use by callers that build tenant context outside the OSS server class without pulling in the bundled UI or mock agent.

  Breaking change: entity RPC URLs moved from `/:type/:instanceId/...` to `/_electric/entities/:type/:instanceId/...`. This affects entity spawn/get/head/delete, send, fork, tag, and schedule endpoints. The root namespace is now durable-streams pass-through, with no reserved entity control routes.

  Breaking change: the `@electric-ax/agents-server` package root now only exports the library-mode routing assembly surface: DB setup helpers, `AgentsHost`, `StreamClient`, `globalRouter`, `TenantContext`, `GlobalRoutes`, `EntityBridgeCoordinator`, and tenant helpers. OSS server classes, subrouters, entity-manager internals, scheduler/wake-registry internals, schema helpers, and entity response helpers are no longer root exports.

  The runtime server client, bundled agents-server UI, and conformance tests have been updated for the new route layout. Agents-server control-plane routes now use shared TypeBox/Ajv body validation.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1df7cce: Add Model Context Protocol (MCP) support — agents can call tools, read resources, and use prompts from external MCP servers (stdio + Streamable HTTP), with OAuth handled by the runtime. New `@electric-ax/agents-mcp` package ships the `Registry` API, transports, OAuth bridges, and opt-in `keychainPersistence` / `filePersistence` helpers. The Electron desktop app exposes a Settings → MCP Servers page and a `mcp.servers` block in `settings.json` that layers with the per-workspace `mcp.json`. Built-in `horton` and `worker` agents see registered MCP tools transparently via `mcp.tools()`.

### Patch Changes

- 65f0cf0: Add `openai-codex` as a built-in model provider. When the user has logged into OpenAI Codex CLI (`~/.codex/auth.json` exists), GPT-5.x models automatically appear in the dashboard model dropdown with reasoning effort support.
- f509387: Allow Horton and Worker to use configured Anthropic or OpenAI models. Adds a `model-catalog` that selects providers from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`, surfaces UI-selectable reasoning effort for compatible OpenAI reasoning models, and threads the catalog through `bootstrap`, `registerHorton`, `registerWorker`, and `spawnWorker`.
- 590aabb: Improve the agents UI timeline and reactivity, add a browser-safe runtime client export, and route built-in agent metadata extraction through the configurable low-cost model runner.
- 28d127b: Electron desktop shell, tile-based workspace, and per-session
  working-directory picker.
  - `@electric-ax/agents-desktop`: new package — Electron app
    bundling a local Horton runtime, system-tray status, multi-
    window support, frameless windows with in-app title bars,
    native menus, About dialog, on-launch API key prompt
    (Anthropic / OpenAI / Brave), localhost agent-server discovery,
    and HMR via `vite-plugin-electron`.
  - `@electric-ax/agents-server`: entrypoint support for the local
    desktop runtime wiring.
  - `@electric-ax/agents-server-ui`: tile-based workspace (DnD,
    splits, persisted layouts, shareable URLs), redesigned new-
    session screen, refreshed dropdown chrome (`Combobox`
    primitive, sentence-case section headings, ServerPicker-style
    rows), sidebar filter & view menu with grouping by date /
    type / status / working dir, full Settings screen with
    General / Appearance / Local Runtime categories.
  - `@electric-ax/agents`: Horton accepts an optional
    `workingDirectory` spawn arg so each session can run against
    its own project root without restarting the runtime.
  - `@electric-ax/agents-runtime`: tool-pair preservation during
    compaction and matching tool-call events by id (bug fixes
    surfaced while building the desktop UI).
  - `@electric-sql/experimental`, `@electric-sql/react`: align test
    type configuration with DOM AbortSignal types used by the client.

- a3cee92: Remove the coder entity (coding-session). The `registerCodingSession`, `useCodingAgent`, `CodingSessionHandle`, and related types/tools (`spawn_coder`, `prompt_coder`) are no longer available. The `agent-session-protocol` dependency is also removed.
- 7f8947a: Require low-cost model calls to provide an explicit system prompt and add prompts for URL extraction and skill metadata extraction.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 4d8e452: Bundle Electric Agents documentation with the package so Horton can search docs without an external docs directory. Copies 39 markdown files from the docs site into `packages/agents/docs/` and updates `resolveDocsRoot` to find them relative to the module directory in both development and production builds.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 491ba04: Move tool implementations (bash, read, write, edit, fetch_url, web_search, schedules) from agents-server to agents package, removing duplicate code. Tools are now exported from `@electric-ax/agents`.
- 4fc022b: Redesign Horton onboarding: rename tutorial to quickstart skill (extended with routes + frontend phases), add init skill for project scaffolding, add onboarding routing to system prompt, configurable docs URL via HORTON_DOCS_URL, upgrade to claude-sonnet-4-6, fix web search fallback tool definition, and remove duplicate braveSearchTool from agents-server (now exported from agents)
- 4987694: Move tool implementations (bash, read, write, edit, fetch_url, web_search, schedules) from `@electric-ax/agents` to `@electric-ax/agents-runtime` so they are available without importing the built-in agents package. **Breaking:** tool exports removed from `@electric-ax/agents` — import from `@electric-ax/agents-runtime` instead.

### Patch Changes

- 89debcf: Add the `coder` entity (a Claude Code / Codex CLI session wrapped as a long-lived entity) and give Horton matching `spawn_coder` / `prompt_coder` tools so the chatbot can dispatch coding work and keep prompting the same coder across many turns. The coder records its own `runs` events around each CLI invocation and pipes the assistant reply through `attachResponse`, so observers waking with `runFinished` get the response in the wake payload. Includes `--skip-git-repo-check` for `codex exec`, deterministic per-cwd Claude session discovery (so non-interactive `claude -p` runs are found reliably), and adopts the first prompt's text as the entity's display title.
