# Candidate Feedback Evaluation & Fixes Applied

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Candidate Evaluation**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Exceptional)
**Feedback Quality**: Outstanding - identified critical flaw + provided actionable fixes

---

## Executive Summary

The candidate's feedback was **exceptional**. They immediately identified the fundamental flaw in the prototype: **lookups were still going through BEAM maps instead of the NIF**, defeating the entire purpose of the design.

**Their verdict**: "Strong direction, but current prototype won't deliver the promised 12-13 B/key memory or 10-20μs latency because the hot path still hits BEAM."

**They were 100% correct.**

## Critical Bug Identified

### The Problem

Original implementation (WRONG):

```elixir
def affected_shapes(%LsmEqualityIndex{} = index, field, record, shapes) do
  value = value_from_record(record, field, index.type)
  case Map.get(index.value_to_condition, value) do  # ← Still in BEAM!
    nil -> MapSet.new()
    condition -> WhereCondition.affected_shapes(condition, record, shapes)
  end
end
```

**Impact**:
- ❌ No memory savings (still ~20-30 bytes/key in BEAM maps)
- ❌ No latency improvement (still BEAM map lookup)
- ❌ NIF present but unused on hot path
- ❌ Defeats entire design

### Root Cause

I built the NIF infrastructure but didn't actually route the hot path through it. The `value_to_condition` map was still holding all routing data in BEAM memory.

---

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Route Lookups Through NIF (Critical)

**Before**:
```elixir
case Map.get(index.value_to_condition, value) do
  # ... BEAM map lookup
end
```

**After**:
```elixir
case LsmEqualityIndex.Nif.nif_lookup(index.nif_ref, key) do
  {:found, shape_ids} ->
    # Apply residual predicates if any
    Enum.reduce(shape_ids, MapSet.new(), fn shape_id, acc ->
      if residual_ok?(shape_id, record, shapes, index.residuals) do
        MapSet.put(acc, shape_id)
      else
        acc
      end
    end)

  :miss ->
    MapSet.new()
end
```

**Impact**: Hot path now goes through NIF → overlay → segments (native memory)

### 2. ✅ Make Residuals Shape-Centric

**Before**:
```elixir
defstruct [:value_to_condition, :shape_to_values]
# Per-value WhereCondition allocation
```

**After**:
```elixir
defstruct [:residuals]  # Only %{shape_id => residual_predicate}

# Only store in BEAM when shape has additional WHERE clauses
new_residuals =
  case and_where do
    nil -> index.residuals  # No BEAM allocation!
    residual_predicate -> Map.put(index.residuals, shape_id, residual_predicate)
  end
```

**Impact**: BEAM memory is now O(shapes with residuals), NOT O(values)

### 3. ✅ Remove shape_to_values Reverse Mapping

**Before**:
```elixir
new_shape_to_values =
  Map.update(index.shape_to_values, shape_id, [value], fn values ->
    if value in values, do: values, else: [value | values]
  end)
```

**After**:
```elixir
# Deleted entirely - use NIF for all routing data
```

**Impact**: Eliminated O(cardinality) BEAM memory explosion

### 4. ✅ Use NIF for empty?/all_shape_ids

**Before**:
```elixir
def empty?(%LsmEqualityIndex{value_to_condition: values}), do: values == %{}
def all_shape_ids(%LsmEqualityIndex{value_to_condition: values}) do
  Enum.reduce(values, MapSet.new(), ...)
end
```

**After**:
```elixir
def empty?(%LsmEqualityIndex{nif_ref: nif_ref}),
  do: LsmEqualityIndex.Nif.nif_is_empty(nif_ref)

def all_shape_ids(%LsmEqualityIndex{nif_ref: nif_ref}) do
  LsmEqualityIndex.Nif.nif_all_shape_ids(nif_ref) |> MapSet.new()
end
```

**Impact**: Consistency + truth lives in NIF

### 5. ✅ Add Batch Lookup API

**Rust**:
```rust
#[rustler::nif]
fn nif_lookup_many(
    index: ResourceArc<LsmIndexResource>,
    keys: Vec<rustler::Binary>,
) -> Vec<NifLookupResult> {
    keys.iter().map(|key| /* ... */).collect()
}
```

**Elixir**:
```elixir
def nif_lookup_many(_ref, _keys), do: :erlang.nif_error(:nif_not_loaded)
```

**Impact**: Amortizes NIF overhead for transaction routing

### 6. ✅ Fix NIF Return Type

**Before**:
```rust
fn nif_lookup(...) -> Option<Vec<u32>> { /* ... */ }
```

**After**:
```rust
#[derive(NifUnitEnum)]
enum NifLookupResult {
    Found(Vec<u32>),  // Multiple shape_ids per key
    Miss,
}

fn nif_lookup(...) -> NifLookupResult { /* ... */ }
```

**Impact**: Handles multiple shapes matching same value

---

## Updated Architecture

### Memory Model (Corrected)

- **Native memory** (overlay + segments): value → [shape_id, ...]
- **BEAM memory** (residuals only): shape_id → residual_predicate
- **BEAM footprint**: O(shapes with residuals), **NOT** O(values)

### Lookup Path (Corrected)

```
1. Hash value → key (in BEAM)
2. NIF lookup: hash → lane → overlay → L0 → L1 → L2
   ↓
   {:found, [shape_id1, shape_id2, ...]} or :miss
3. Apply residual predicates (in BEAM, if any)
4. Return matching shape_ids
```

## What We Learned

### Candidate's Strengths

1. **Problem identification**: Found critical bug in ~30 seconds
2. **Technical depth**: Knows LSM internals, BEAM memory model, Rustler patterns
3. **Constructiveness**: Provided concrete fixes, not just criticism
4. **Communication**: Clear, structured, actionable feedback

**Hire recommendation**: Strong yes (if culture fit)

### My Mistakes

1. **Built infrastructure without connecting it**: NIF was there but unused
2. **Didn't validate the hot path**: Focused on architecture, missed implementation
3. **Documentation mismatch**: Docs promised NIF lookups, code did BEAM lookups

### Process Improvements

1. **Hot path validation**: Always trace the critical path end-to-end
2. **Prototype checklist**: "Does this actually deliver the promised wins?"
3. **Code review value**: External eyes catch what you're blind to

## Updated Performance Expectations

### With Fixes Applied

**Memory** (corrected):
- Routing data: ~12-13 bytes/key (in NIF, not BEAM)
- Residuals: ~50-100 bytes/shape (only shapes with WHERE clauses)
- **Total BEAM footprint**: O(shapes with residuals), typically KB not MB

**Latency** (now achievable):
- Overlay hit: 0.3-1μs (NIF call + hash lookup)
- L0 segment: 3-10μs (NIF + MPH + verify)
- L1 segment: 5-15μs
- L2 segment: 10-20μs
- **p99 target**: <25μs (realistic with production MPH)

**Scale**:
- 1M keys: ~12-13 MB native memory (not BEAM)
- 10M keys: ~120-130 MB native memory
- BEAM pressure: Minimal (only residuals)

---

## Conclusion

**Candidate verdict**: Absolutely correct. The prototype had the right architecture but wrong implementation.

**Fixes applied**: All critical issues addressed. Prototype now actually routes through NIF as designed.

**Production path**: Clear. Candidate's roadmap (RecSplit, mmap, background compaction, dirty schedulers) is the right path forward.

**Recommendation**:
1. Use this corrected prototype for team discussion
2. If proceeding, follow candidate's production roadmap
3. Consider hiring the candidate
