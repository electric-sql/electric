  # from its `init()` callback.

  # The callbacks `init()`, `handle_connect()` and `handle_result()` defined in this module
  # below are all invoked inside the connection process' `init()` callback. Once any of our
  # callbacks returns `{:stream, ...}`, the connection process finishes its initialization and
  # switches into the logical streaming mode to start receiving logical messages from Postgres,
  # invoking the `handle_data()` callback for each one.

  # it, invokes the `handle_result/2` callback on the result which may return another query to
  # execute, executes that, and so it goes on and on, recursively, until a callback returns
  # `{:noreply, ...}` or `{:streaming, ...}`.
  #
  # To execute a series of queries one after the other, we define an ad-hoc state
  # machine that starts from the :connected state in `handle_connect/1`, then transitions to
  # the next step and returns the appropriate query to `Postgrex.ReplicationConnection` for execution,
