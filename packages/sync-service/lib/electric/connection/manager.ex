defmodule Electric.Connection.Manager do
  @moduledoc """
  Custom initialisation and reconnection logic for database connections.

  This module is esentially a supervisor for database connections, implemented as a GenServer.
  Unlike an OTP process supervisor, it includes additional functionality:

    - adjusting connection options based on the response from the database
    - monitoring connections and initiating a reconnection procedure
    - custom reconnection logic with exponential backoff
    - starting the shape consumer supervisor tree once a database connection pool
      has been initialized

  Your OTP application should start a singleton connection manager under its main supervision tree:

      children = [
        ...,metadata
        {Electric.Connection.Manager,
         stack_id: ...,
         connection_opts: [...],
         replication_opts: [...],
         pool_opts: [...],
         timeline_opts: [...],
         shape_cache_opts: [...]}
      ]

      Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  """

  # We model the connection manager as a state machine with 2 levels of state. On the 1st
  # level, it can be in one of two phases:
  #
  #   - :connection_setup
  #   - :running
  #
  # Connection manager starts in the :connection_setup phase and moves into the :running phase
  # after all processes have been started and the replication client is given the command to
  # start streaming.
  #
  # If any connection process exits, connection manager itself will shut down to start
  # from scratch, as there could be too many failure states to address each one individually.
  #
  # The 2nd level of the state machine splits the current phase into a series of steps which
  # the process goes through until it finishes the connection setup phase and transitions into
  # the running phase.
  #
  # Function clauses match on the current phase and step as a way to both assert on the current
  # state as well as make the code more self-documenting.
