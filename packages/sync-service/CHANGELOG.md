- 1461432: Replace individual persistence location configuration with a single `STORAGE_DIR` environment variable, that should be bound to a volume to survive Electric restarts. If you were using `CUBDB_FILE_PATH`, you should move that folder into a subdirectory named `shapes` and configure `STORAGE_DIR` to the previous directory.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- f809c8d: JSON encoding on write rather than read to reduce memory footprint. For example the memory use of an initial sync of a 35MB/200k row table has been reduced from 50MB to 25MB on the first initial sync (which includes the encoding and the writing to storage) and to 6MB on subsequent initial syncs (where we just read from storage and there's no encoding).

- d5c268d: Reduce memory footprint of initial sync by streaming data from storage, for example a 35MB / 200k row table did require 550MB but now requires 50MB
- 358e0ab: Add PK index of column is part of the PK in the column information that is part of the schema information returned in the x-electric-schema
  HTTP header.
