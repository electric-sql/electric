## 1.3.4

### Patch Changes

- a1b736f: Fix dependency tracking for nested subqueries when intermediate rows change their linking column without changing the tracked column. Previously, such updates were incorrectly filtered out, causing stale tag tracking that led to incorrect row deletions when the old parent lost its qualifying status.
- dba090e: Fix RelationTracker not syncing with Configurator after restart

  When the RelationTracker restarts while the Configurator is still running, it now properly notifies the Configurator of the restored filters. Previously, after a RelationTracker restart, subsequent shape removals would not update the publication because the internal filter state was inconsistent.

- ba6dd2c: Optimize shape metadata operations by introducing an ETS-based write-through cache with asynchronous SQLite writes

## 1.3.3

### Patch Changes

- b2d28cf: Fix race condition in Materializer startup where the Materializer would crash if the Consumer died during `await_snapshot_start` or `subscribe_materializer` calls. The Materializer now handles GenServer.call exits gracefully and shuts down cleanly.
- edd8fe3: Fix race condition crash in ConsumerRegistry when shape is removed during transaction processing
- d3a79b0: Make rate limit error a known error

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 8fa682c: Skip hex.pm publish when version already exists to avoid unnecessary CI builds
- c162905: Fix crash when subquery column is NULL

  Fixes a crash (`ArgumentError: not an iodata term`) when using on-demand sync with subqueries (e.g., `task_id IN (SELECT ...)`) and rows have NULL values in the referenced column.

  **Root cause:** In `make_tags`, the SQL expression `md5('...' || col::text)` returns NULL when `col` is NULL (because `|| NULL` = NULL in PostgreSQL). This NULL propagates through all string concatenation in the row's JSON construction, causing the encoder to receive `nil` instead of valid iodata.

  **Fix:** Namespace column values with a `v:` prefix, and represent NULL as `NULL` (no prefix). This ensures:
  - NULL values don't propagate through concatenation
  - NULL and the string literal `'NULL'` produce distinct hashes
  - No restrictions on what values users can have in their columns

- fe2c6b2: Fix ETS read/write race condition in PureFileStorage

  Fixed a race condition where readers could miss data when using stale metadata to read from ETS while a concurrent flush was clearing the ETS buffer. The fix detects both empty and partial ETS reads and retries with fresh metadata, which will correctly read from disk after the flush completes.

## 1.2.7

### Patch Changes

- f0b83fa: Fix subset\_\_params to use constant parameter name for proxy configurations

  Changed subset**params from deepObject style (subset**params[1], subset**params[2]) to JSON serialization (subset**params={"1":"value1","2":"value2"}). This allows proxy configurations to match the constant parameter name "subset\_\_params" in ELECTRIC_PROTOCOL_QUERY_PARAMS without needing dynamic pattern matching.

## 1.2.6

### Patch Changes

- 2d1d268: Ensure shape consumers idempotently handle transactions using log offset comparisons.
- b71e46c: Fix retry-after header not being exposed via CORS

  The server was sending the retry-after header to clients during overload scenarios (503 responses), but the header was not included in the access-control-expose-headers CORS header. This caused browsers to block access to the retry-after value, preventing clients from honoring the server's backoff directive.

  As a result, clients would ignore the server's retry-after header and use only exponential backoff with jitter, which could result in very short retry delays (as low as 0-100ms on early retries), leading to intense retry loops during server overload.

- ff45de1: Replace max LSN recovery from on-disk shapes with direct read from replication slot flushed LSN.

- 965ef47: feat: add support for `changes_only` mode, subset snapshots, and `offset=now`
  - `changes_only` - in this mode the server will not create initial snapshot for the shape, the clients will start receiving changes without seeing base data. Best paired with...
  - Subset snapshots - the server now accepts a `subset__*` set of parameters, which when provided result in a special-form response containing a snapshot of a subset (may be full) of a shape, and information on how to position this response in the stream. The client exposes a new method `requestSnapshot` which will make this request and then inject the response into the correct place in the subscribed messages stream, bounded with a `snapshot-end` control message.
  - `offset=now` - the server now accepts a `offset=now` special value, in which case the client will receive an immediate up-to-date response with the latest possible continuation offset, allowing it to skip all historical data and start "from scratch". This works best with `changes_only` and subset snapshots where a client doesn't keep state and upon a reload needs to start fresh without historical data.

  publication.

  This is useful when the database role that Electric uses to connect to Postgres
  does not own user tables. Adding tables to the publication by hand and
  setting their REPLICA IDENTITY to FULL allows Electric to stream changes from
  them regardless.

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 8ad40e7: Make relation OID part of shape definition, removing the need for persisting relations and simplifying relation change handling.
- 41845cb: Fix inconsistencies in http proxies for caching live long-polling requests.

  The server now returns a cursor for the client to use in requests to cache-bust any stale caches.

- 14681cc: Store shape definitions along with shape data and use that to restore them instead of persisted cached metadata. This removes the unified serilization and persistence of all shape metadata and allows better scaling of speed of shape creation.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- b3f5d7c: Introduce and enable by default a new iteration of the storage engine, which is more optimal when creating new shapes. If you need to continue using the old shapes without interruption, set `STORAGE=cubdb` environment variable.
- 1461432: Replace individual persistence location configuration with a single `STORAGE_DIR` environment variable, that should be bound to a volume to survive Electric restarts. If you were using `CUBDB_FILE_PATH`, you should move that folder into a subdirectory named `shapes` and configure `STORAGE_DIR` to the previous directory.

- 9faab42: Move to process- and storage-per-shape

## 0.3.5

- f809c8d: JSON encoding on write rather than read to reduce memory footprint. For example the memory use of an initial sync of a 35MB/200k row table has been reduced from 50MB to 25MB on the first initial sync (which includes the encoding and the writing to storage) and to 6MB on subsequent initial syncs (where we just read from storage and there's no encoding).

## 0.2.5

- 5522305: Enforce the use of consistent display formats for both the initial snapshot and the live replication stream.

- 715d2cb: Include schema information in HTTP response header.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 36b9ab5: Send only changed columns and PKs on updates instead of full rows, and only PKs on deletes. Also tackle a case where we change a PK of a row - this is split into a delete+insert operations that reference each other using header metadata
