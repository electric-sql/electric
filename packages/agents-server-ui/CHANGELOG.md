# @electric-ax/agents-server-ui

## 0.4.2

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- dfc9a45: Combine the desktop app packaging setup, app settings, and agents UI improvements. Adds desktop packaging assets/configuration, multi-server desktop settings, improved chat and workspace UI behavior, and queued inbox message modes in the runtime.
- 83204d9: Add principals support to the agents system. Every API request now carries a `Principal` (user, agent, service, or system) threaded through the full request lifecycle. Runner dispatch is scoped to the authenticated owner via dispatch policy authorization. The runtime exposes `ctx.principal` in handler context so agent code can implement principal-aware logic. The server UI uses asserted identity headers for dev-mode authentication.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 08e85a0: Refactor agents-server HTTP routing around a single `globalRouter` entrypoint passed a flat `TenantContext`.

  The `ElectricAgentsServer` class now owns lifecycle setup only and dispatches each request through an OSS-only wrapper router that layers dashboard and mock-agent routes over `globalRouter.fetch(request, tenantContext)`. This prepares the exported `globalRouter` for library-mode use by callers that build tenant context outside the OSS server class without pulling in the bundled UI or mock agent.

  Breaking change: entity RPC URLs moved from `/:type/:instanceId/...` to `/_electric/entities/:type/:instanceId/...`. This affects entity spawn/get/head/delete, send, fork, tag, and schedule endpoints. The root namespace is now durable-streams pass-through, with no reserved entity control routes.

  Breaking change: the `@electric-ax/agents-server` package root now only exports the library-mode routing assembly surface: DB setup helpers, `AgentsHost`, `StreamClient`, `globalRouter`, `TenantContext`, `GlobalRoutes`, `EntityBridgeCoordinator`, and tenant helpers. OSS server classes, subrouters, entity-manager internals, scheduler/wake-registry internals, schema helpers, and entity response helpers are no longer root exports.

  The runtime server client, bundled agents-server UI, and conformance tests have been updated for the new route layout. Agents-server control-plane routes now use shared TypeBox/Ajv body validation.

### Patch Changes

- dec65ae: Port pull-wake runners onto the tenant-aware agents-server routing refactor.

  Agents-server now supports runner registration, runner-owned pull-wake subscriptions, dispatch policy resolution, subscription stream linking, compact Durable Streams wake claims, callback-forward claim lifecycle handling, and claim-scoped write tokens. Runtime built-ins can register pull-wake runners, tail runner wake streams, claim work through the server, heartbeat offsets, and acknowledge completed work. The CLI, desktop integration, server UI, and local full-stack compose setup now use runner-backed local sessions for the pull-wake flow.

  Saved agents-server connections can include additional request headers for tenant-aware deployments, and CLI/runtime URL handling now preserves base query parameters such as `?secret=...`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1df7cce: Add Model Context Protocol (MCP) support — agents can call tools, read resources, and use prompts from external MCP servers (stdio + Streamable HTTP), with OAuth handled by the runtime. New `@electric-ax/agents-mcp` package ships the `Registry` API, transports, OAuth bridges, and opt-in `keychainPersistence` / `filePersistence` helpers. The Electron desktop app exposes a Settings → MCP Servers page and a `mcp.servers` block in `settings.json` that layers with the per-workspace `mcp.json`. Built-in `horton` and `worker` agents see registered MCP tools transparently via `mcp.tools()`.

### Patch Changes

- f509387: Redesign.
- 590aabb: Improve the agents UI timeline and reactivity, add a browser-safe runtime client export, and route built-in agent metadata extraction through the configurable low-cost model runner.
- 28d127b: Electron desktop shell, tile-based workspace, and per-session
  working-directory picker.
  - `@electric-ax/agents-desktop`: new package — Electron app
    bundling a local Horton runtime, system-tray status, multi-
    window support, frameless windows with in-app title bars,
    native menus, About dialog, on-launch API key prompt
    (Anthropic / OpenAI / Brave), localhost agent-server discovery,
    and HMR via `vite-plugin-electron`.
  - `@electric-ax/agents-server`: entrypoint support for the local
    desktop runtime wiring.
  - `@electric-ax/agents-server-ui`: tile-based workspace (DnD,
    splits, persisted layouts, shareable URLs), redesigned new-
    session screen, refreshed dropdown chrome (`Combobox`
    primitive, sentence-case section headings, ServerPicker-style
    rows), sidebar filter & view menu with grouping by date /
    type / status / working dir, full Settings screen with
    General / Appearance / Local Runtime categories.
  - `@electric-ax/agents`: Horton accepts an optional
    `workingDirectory` spawn arg so each session can run against
    its own project root without restarting the runtime.
  - `@electric-ax/agents-runtime`: tool-pair preservation during
    compaction and matching tool-call events by id (bug fixes
    surfaced while building the desktop UI).
  - `@electric-sql/experimental`, `@electric-sql/react`: align test
    type configuration with DOM AbortSignal types used by the client.

- a3cee92: Remove the coder entity (coding-session). The `registerCodingSession`, `useCodingAgent`, `CodingSessionHandle`, and related types/tools (`spawn_coder`, `prompt_coder`) are no longer available. The `agent-session-protocol` dependency is also removed.

### Patch Changes

- 89debcf: Coder-session UI improvements: a dedicated 3-tab Create / Attach / Import spawn dialog routed in from the sidebar's _New session_ flow, a timeline view that shows queued user prompts immediately as a "queued" bubble (matched against canonical `user_message` events by text so they swap cleanly when the CLI mirrors the JSONL back), and a session header that surfaces the full `nativeSessionId` for copy/paste against on-disk session files.
