# Release Post

Ship often, communicate clearly, don't overthink it. The workhorse format
for incremental releases, new features, and point releases.

## When to use

You shipped something and want to tell people about it. This is the
keep-it-simple format for ticking-along releases. Bigger launches that
represent a category shift should use the Best Sales Deck format instead.

## Reference examples

- [Electric 1.0 released](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/blob/main/website/blog/posts/2025-03-17-electricsql-1.0-released.md) — thruflo
- [Announcing Hosted Durable Streams](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/blob/main/website/blog/posts/2026-01-22-announcing-hosted-durable-streams.md) — kyle

## Structure

No narrative arc needed. Lead with what shipped and why it matters.
The TLDR *is* the what and why — no separate setup section.

```
[TLDR — this IS the what and why. 1-2 paras: what shipped,
 why it matters, key benefit. Info box with key links.]

## Context

- Brief orientation for readers not already tracking this
- 2-3 bullets max. If it needs more, link to a previous post
- Not a backstory — just enough to make the rest make sense

## What's shipping

- Concrete capabilities, numbers, facts
- Lead with benefits, follow with specifics
- Each bullet is a thing the reader can now do that they couldn't before

<!-- SOCIAL PROOF: embed positive tweets, quotes from users/community
     about the need for this or reactions to it. -->

<!-- ASSET: demo video with poster frame, or screenshot,
     or external blog post image tiles -->

## Get started

- Code samples, commands, steps
- Show don't tell — the reader should be able to try it

## Coming next

- Brief roadmap tease. 2-3 bullets
- Keeps momentum, shows we're not stopping

***

Next steps:

- CTAs: docs, cloud signup, discord
```

## Tone guidance

- Factual and brisk. This is a shipping cadence post, not an essay
- Dry is fine — let the content do the work
- Liven it up with: a good header image, video with poster frame,
  embedded tweets, external blog post image tiles
- No preamble, no throat-clearing. The TLDR opens the post and
  that's the pitch
- Celebrate shipping without overselling what shipped

## Visual elements

Release posts benefit from visual variety to break up what can
otherwise be a dry feature list:

- Demo video with a poster frame
- Screenshots of new UI or output
- Embedded tweets showing community need or positive reactions
- External blog post tiles linking to deeper dives
- Code samples showing the new thing in action

## Evaluation criteria

- Can the reader understand what shipped and why they should care
  in the first 30 seconds?
- Are benefits concrete or vague?
- Is there a visual element breaking up the text?
- Can the reader get started immediately from this post?
- Is the context section brief enough or is it becoming a backstory?
