# Best Sales Deck

Based on Andy Raskin's "Greatest Sales Deck I've Ever Seen" framework:
name a big change, show winners and losers, tease the promised land,
deliver magic gifts. Adapted for technical blog posts — the structure
does the persuasion, the tone stays Ronseal straight.

## When to use

You're introducing a concept, pattern, or paradigm shift to a technical
audience. You want to sell an idea — not with marketing language but with
the logic of "the world changed, here's what that means, here's how to
be on the right side of it."

Good for: product launches that represent a category shift, thought
leadership on emerging patterns, "why X matters now" concept pieces.

## Structure

The outline names each step of the narrative flow explicitly. The labels
are working structure — in the final prose they dissolve into section
headings that feel natural, not formulaic.

```
[TLDR + info box — standard, see SKILL.md]

The big change:

- Name an undeniable shift that's happening in the world
- This should be observable, not a claim — the reader can verify it
- Keep it factual and concrete, not hyperbolic
- This is NOT your product or company — it's the world changing

Winners and losers:

- This change creates stakes — show who benefits and who doesn't
- Make it concrete: "teams doing X ship in days, teams doing Y are
  still gluing together retry logic"
- The reader should see themselves (or want to see themselves)
  in the winners column

The promised land:

- Paint what life looks like on the right side of this shift
- Don't introduce the solution yet — describe the outcome
- This should feel desirable and specific, not utopian
- The reader should want this before knowing how to get it

The magic gifts:

- Now introduce the thing that gets you there
- Each gift is a specific capability, not a feature list item
- Frame as "this is what makes the promised land reachable"
- These become the ## headings for the body

## Gift a

- What it is, how it works, why it matters
- Evidence: benchmarks, code samples, demos

## Gift b

- ...

## Gift c

- ...

## Ethos / creative angle

Same as pyramid principle — the Big Change and Winners/Losers sections
should be enhanced with a specific story or moment drawn from the author.
The logic comes first, then the creative angle makes it land.

The key difference from pyramid: here the anecdote grounds the *change*,
not the *shared reality*. It answers "how do I know this change is real?"
with lived experience rather than assertion.

## Tone guidance

- The structure is a sales deck. The tone is Ronseal
- The TLDR already gave the reader the punchline — the body gives them
  the reasoning to believe it
- No: "revolutionary", "game-changing", "unlock the power of"
- Yes: specific numbers, concrete scenarios, "here's what this looks
  like in practice"
- Technical audience respects being shown, not told
- The persuasion comes from the logic of the narrative arc, not from
  the language used to express it

## Key principles from Raskin's framework

- **Start with change, not pain.** The big change is not "you have a
  problem" — it's "the world shifted." This reframes the conversation
  from selling to informing.
- **The promised land is not your product.** It's the outcome the reader
  wants. The product is how you get there. Keep these separate.
- **Magic gifts earn the promised land.** Each gift should clearly connect
  to the promised land. If a gift doesn't advance the reader toward
  the outcome, cut it.
- **Show proof.** The framework works because each step builds credibility
  for the next. The big change is verifiable. The winners/losers are
  observable. The promised land is desirable. The gifts are demonstrable.

## Evaluation criteria

- Is the big change genuinely undeniable or are we asserting something
  self-serving?
- Do the winners/losers feel real or is it a strawman?
- Does the promised land describe outcomes, not features?
- Do the magic gifts actually deliver the promised land or is there a gap?
- Would a skeptical engineer read this and nod, or roll their eyes?
