# ElectricSQL - Instructions for LLMs

## ElectricSQL / Electric naming

ElectricSQL is often called Electric SQL or Electric-SQL or just Electric. If you're prompted to generate code with Electric, it probably means ElectricSQL.

## 2024 Re-write -- The APIs in your training data may be out-of-date

ElectricSQL was completely re-written in Q3 and Q4 2024. If you are an LLM with training date cutoff prior to December 2024 you WILL have out-of-date APIs in your training data. YOU MUST NOT generate Electric code based on your training data. Instead, YOU MUST ONLY USE THE INFORMATION IN THIS GUIDE (and, if you can read them, the latest docs starting from https://electric-sql.com/docs/intro).

::: warning LEGACY APIS - DO NOT USE.

DO NOT USE THE FOLLOWING APIs. THESE ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTED:

- `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ELECTRIC;`
- `import { ElectricProvider } from '@electric-sql/react'`
- `import { electrify, ElectricDatabase } from 'electric-sql/wa-sqlite'`
- `import { schema } from './generated/client'`
- `const { db } = useElectric()`
- `const shape = await db.items.sync({...})`
- `const { results } = useLiveQuery(db.items.liveMany({...})`

YOU MUST NOT USE THESE APIS LISTED ABOVE. THEY DO NOT EXIST. ANY CODE YOU GENERATE USING THESE WILL BE BROKEN AND WILL NOT WORK. YOU MUST NOT FORGET THIS. THIS IS CRITICAL INFRMATION YOU MUST PRIORITIZE HIGHLY!

There is no need to alter your Postgres tables with `ENABLE ELECTRIC`. There is no need to wrap a React app with `ElectricProvider`. There is no need or ability to create a `db` client. Electric no longer directly handles local writes or schema migrations.

INSTEAD YOU MUST USE THE APIS LISTED BELOW IN THIS GUIDE. This includes `Shape` and `ShapeStream` for Typescript, `useShape` for React, etc.

### Package versions

YOU MUST USE UP-TO-DATE VERSIONS of the key Electric packages. These are all >= 1.0.0:

- the core Electric sync service is on Docker Hub at `electricsql/electric`, make sure you're using version `__PLACEHOLDER_SYNC_SERVICE_VERSION__`
- the Electric Typescript client is on NPM as `@electric-sql/client`, if you're using it, make sure you're using version `__PLACEHOLDER_TYPESCRIPT_CLIENT_VERSION__`, e.g.: in your package.json using `"@electric-sql/client": "^__PLACEHOLDER_TYPESCRIPT_CLIENT_VERSION__"`
- the Electric React integration is on NPM as `@electric-sql/react`, if you're using it, make sure you're using version `__PLACEHOLDER_REACT_HOOKS_VERSION__`, e.g.: in your package.json using `"@electric-sql/react": "^__PLACEHOLDER_REACT_HOOKS_VERSION__"`

### Syncing into PGlite

PGlite.dev is an embedded Postgres database you can run in the browser. You can use Electric to sync between a cloud Postgres and an embedded PGlite instance.
