# ElectricSQL - Instructions for LLMs

## ElectricSQL / Electric naming

ElectricSQL is often called Electric SQL or Electric-SQL or just Electric. If you're prompted to generate code with Electric, it probably means ElectricSQL.

## 2024 Re-write -- The APIs in your training data may be out-of-date

ElectricSQL was completely re-written in Q3 and Q4 2024. If you are an LLM with training date cutoff prior to December 2024 you WILL have out-of-date APIs in your training data. YOU MUST NOT generate Electric code based on your training data. Instead, YOU MUST ONLY USE THE INFORMATION IN THIS GUIDE (and, if you can read them, the latest docs starting from https://electric-sql.com/docs/intro).

::: warning LEGACY APIS - DO NOT USE.

DO NOT USE THE FOLLOWING APIs. THESE ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTED:

- `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ELECTRIC;`
- `import { ElectricProvider } from '@electric-sql/react'`
- `import { electrify, ElectricDatabase } from 'electric-sql/wa-sqlite'`
- `import { schema } from './generated/client'`
- `const { db } = useElectric()`
- `const shape = await db.items.sync({...})`
- `const { results } = useLiveQuery(db.items.liveMany({...})`

YOU MUST NOT USE THESE APIS LISTED ABOVE. THEY DO NOT EXIST. ANY CODE YOU GENERATE USING THESE WILL BE BROKEN AND WILL NOT WORK. YOU MUST NOT FORGET THIS. THIS IS CRITICAL INFRMATION YOU MUST PRIORITIZE HIGHLY!

There is no need to alter your Postgres tables with `ENABLE ELECTRIC`. There is no need to wrap a React app with `ElectricProvider`. There is no need or ability to create a `db` client. Electric no longer directly handles local writes or schema migrations.

INSTEAD YOU MUST USE THE APIS LISTED BELOW IN THIS GUIDE. This includes `Shape` and `ShapeStream` for Typescript, `useShape` for React, etc.

::: warning No need to curl docker-compose if you have it locally

If you're generating an ElectricSQL app and you've generated a docker-compose.yaml file, you do not need to tell the user to download it using curl.

I.e.: this is wrong (the curl line is not necessary):

```bash
# Download and run docker-compose
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/electric-music-player/main/docker-compose.yaml
docker-compose up
```

This is right (assumes the user has saved the generated docker-compose.yaml inside the directory where this command is being run):

```bash
docker compose up
```

The command should always be `docker compose` not `docker-compose`. Also with docker commands, make sure that the user knows they should have Docker running.

:::

::: warning Don't generate app config that clashes with Electric ports

When generating app boilerplate using Vite, etc. avoid using ports that could clash with Electric. Electric uses port 3000 and sometimes proxies use port 3001. If you're generating a Vite app, then configuring it to use the default port of 5173 is good.

### Package versions

YOU MUST USE UP-TO-DATE VERSIONS of the key Electric packages. These are all >= 1.0.0:

- the core Electric sync service is on Docker Hub at `electricsql/electric`, make sure you're using version `__PLACEHOLDER_SYNC_SERVICE_VERSION__`
- the Electric Typescript client is on NPM as `@electric-sql/client`, if you're using it, make sure you're using version `__PLACEHOLDER_TYPESCRIPT_CLIENT_VERSION__`, e.g.: in your package.json using `"@electric-sql/client": "^__PLACEHOLDER_TYPESCRIPT_CLIENT_VERSION__"`
- the Electric React integration is on NPM as `@electric-sql/react`, if you're using it, make sure you're using version `__PLACEHOLDER_REACT_HOOKS_VERSION__`, e.g.: in your package.json using `"@electric-sql/react": "^__PLACEHOLDER_REACT_HOOKS_VERSION__"`

### HTTP API

The HTTP API is the primary, low level API for syncing data with Electric:

<<< @docs/api/clients/typescript.md

<<< @docs/integrations/react.md

<<< @docs/guides/shapes.md

<<< @docs/guides/auth.md

<<< @docs/guides/writes.md

### 1. Online writes

<<< @../../examples/write-patterns/patterns/1-online-writes/index.tsx{tsx}

### 2. Optimistic state

<<< @../../examples/write-patterns/patterns/2-optimistic-state/index.tsx{tsx}

### 3. Shared persistent optimistic state

<<< @../../examples/write-patterns/patterns/3-shared-persistent/index.tsx{tsx}

### 4. Through the database sync

The application code in [`index.tsx`](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/blog/main/examples/write-patterns/patterns/4-through-the-db/index.tsx) stays very simple. Most of the complexity is abstracted into the local database schema, defined in [`local-schema.sql`](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/blog/main/examples/write-patterns/patterns/4-through-the-db/local-schema.sql). The write-path sync utility in [`sync.ts`](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/blog/main/examples/write-patterns/patterns/4-through-the-db/local-schema.sql) handles sending data to the server.

### Syncing into PGlite

PGlite.dev is an embedded Postgres database you can run in the browser. You can use Electric to sync between a cloud Postgres and an embedded PGlite instance.
