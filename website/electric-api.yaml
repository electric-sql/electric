        Load the initial data for a shape and poll for real-time updates.

        Define your shape using the `root_table` and `where` parameters.
        Use `offset` to fetch data from a specific position in the shape
        log and the `live` parameter to consume real-time updates.

            Root table of the shape. Must match a table in your Postgres database.

            Can be just a tablename, or can be prefixed by the database schema
            using a `.` delimiter, such as `foo.issues`. If you don't provide
            a schema prefix, then the table is assumed to be in the `public.` schema.

          description: |-
            The offset in the shape stream. This is like a cursor that specifies
            the position in the shape log to request data from.

            When making an initial request to sync a shape from scratch, you
            **must** set the `offset` to `-1`. Then, when continuing to
            sync data, you should set the `offset` to the last offset you have
            already recieved, to continue syncing new data from that position
            in the stream.

            Note that when `offset` is not `-1` then you must also provide
            a `shape_id`.
        - name: live

          schema:
            type: boolean
          description: |-
            Whether to wait for live updates or not.

            When the `live` parameter is omitted or set to `false`, the server
            will always return immediately, with any data it has, followed by an
            up-to-date message.

            Once you're up-to-date, you should set the `live` parameter to `true`.
            This puts the server into live mode, where it will hold open the
            connection, waiting for new data arrive.

            This allows you to implement a long-polling strategy to consume
            real-time updates.

            The shape ID returned by the initial shape request.

            This is a required parameter when this is not an initial sync request.

                  A JSON string of an object that maps column names to the corresponding schema object.
                  The schema object contains the type of the column, the number of dimensions, and possibly additional properties.
                  Non-array types have a dimension of `0`, while array types have a dimension of 1 or more.
                  For instance, an array of booleans would have a type of `bool` and a dimension of `1`.
                  Some types provide additional properties,
                  e.g.: `VARCHAR(8)` has an additional `“max_length": 8` property,
                        `BPCHAR(9)` has an additional `"length": 9` property,
                        `TIME(3)` has an additional `"precision": 3` property,

                        `INTERVAL MINUTE TO SECOND` has an additional `"fields": "MINUTE TO SECOND"` property,
                        `BIT(5)` has an additional `"length": 5` property.

                        The values are strings that are formatted according to Postgres' display settings.
                        Some Postgres types support several display settings, we format values consistently according to the following display settings:

                        - `bytea_output = 'hex'`
                        - `DateStyle = 'ISO, DMY'`
