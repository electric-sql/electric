        Load the initial data for a shape and poll for real-time updates.

        Define your shape using the `table` and `where` parameters.
        Use `offset` to fetch data from a specific position in the shape
        log and the `live` parameter to consume real-time updates.

            Root table of the shape. Must match a table in your Postgres database.

            Can be just a tablename, or can be prefixed by the database schema
            using a `.` delimiter, such as `foo.issues`. If you don't provide
            a schema prefix, then the table is assumed to be in the `public.` schema.

          description: |-
            The offset in the shape stream. This is like a cursor that specifies
            the position in the shape log to request data from.

            When making an initial request to sync a shape from scratch, you
            **must** set the `offset` to `-1`. Then, when continuing to
            sync data, you should set the `offset` to the last offset you have
            already recieved, to continue syncing new data from that position
            in the stream.

            Note that when `offset` is not `-1` then you must also provide
            a `shape_handle`.
        - name: live
          in: query
          schema:
            type: boolean
          description: |-
            Whether to wait for live updates or not.

            When the `live` parameter is omitted or set to `false`, the server
            will always return immediately, with any data it has, followed by an
            up-to-date message.

            Once you're up-to-date, you should set the `live` parameter to `true`.
            This puts the server into live mode, where it will hold open the
            connection, waiting for new data arrive.

            This allows you to implement a long-polling strategy to consume
            real-time updates.
        - name: cursor
          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
          description: |-
            This is a cursor generated by the server during live requests. It helps bust caches for

          example: "3833821-1721812114261"
          description: |-
            The shape handle returned by the initial shape request.

            This is a required parameter when this is not an initial sync request,
            i.e. when offset is not `-1`.
        - name: where

          schema:
            type: string
          description: |-
            Optional where clause to filter rows in the `table`.

            This should be a valid PostgreSQL WHERE clause using SQL syntax.

            For more details on what is supported and what is optimal,
            see the [where clause documentation](https://electric-sql.com/docs/guides/shapes#where-clause).
          examples:
            title_filter:
              value: '"title=''Electric''"'
              summary: Only include rows where the title is 'Electric'.
            status_filter:
              value: '"status IN (''backlog'', ''todo'')"'
              summary: Only include rows whose status is either 'backlog' or 'todo'.

          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
          description: |-
            Optional list of columns to include in the rows from the `table`.

            They should always include the primary key columns, and should be formed
            as a comma separated list of column names exactly as they are in the database schema.

            If the identifier was defined as case sensitive and/or with special characters, then\
            you must quote it in the `columns` parameter as well.
          examples:
            select_columns:
              value: "id,title,status"
              summary: Only include the id, title, and status columns.
            select_columns_special:
              value: 'id,"Status-Check"'
              summary: Only include id and Status-Check columns, quoting the identifiers where necessary.

          description: |-
            Modifies the data sent in update and delete change messages.

            When `replica=default` (the default) only changed columns are
            included in the `value` of an update message and only the primary
            keys are sent for a delete.

            When set to `full` the entire row will be sent for updates and
            deletes.

            Note that insert operations always include the full row,
            in either mode.

                  The schema object contains the type of the column, the number of dimensions, and possibly additional properties.
                  Non-array types have a dimension of `0`, while array types have a dimension of 1 or more.
                  For instance, an array of booleans would have a type of `bool` and a dimension of `1`.
                  Some types provide additional properties,

                        `INTERVAL MINUTE TO SECOND` has an additional `"fields": "MINUTE TO SECOND"` property,

    delete:
      summary: Delete Shape
      description: |-
        Deletes the shape from the Electric sync engine.

        This clears the shape log and forces any clients requesting the shape
        to create a new shape and resync from scratch.

        **NOTE** Delete shape only works if Electric is configured to `allow_shape_deletion`.

            has been invalidated and the storage will be cleaned up eventually).
