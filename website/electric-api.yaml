        Load the initial data for a shape and poll for real-time updates.

        Define your shape using the `table` and `where` parameters.
        Use `offset` to fetch data from a specific position in the shape
        log and the `live` parameter to consume real-time updates.

            The offset in the shape stream. This is like a cursor that specifies
            the position in the shape log to request data from.

            When making an initial request to sync a shape from scratch, you
            **must** set the `offset` to `-1`. Then, when continuing to
            sync data, you should set the `offset` to the last offset you have
            already received, to continue syncing new data from that position
            in the stream.

            Alternatively, you can set `offset` to `now` to skip all historical
            data and receive an immediate up-to-date message with the latest
            continuation offset. This is useful when combined with `log=changes_only`
            mode and `replica=full` for applications that don't need historical data.

            Note that when `offset` is not `-1` or `now` then you must also provide
            the shape's `handle`.

            Whether to wait for live updates or not.

            When the `live` parameter is omitted or set to `false`, the server
            will always return immediately, with any data it has, followed by an
            up-to-date message.

            Once you're up-to-date, you should set the `live` parameter to `true`.
            This puts the server into live mode, where it will hold open the
            connection, waiting for new data arrive.

            This allows you to implement a long-polling strategy to consume
            real-time updates.

          description: |-
            Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live updates instead of long polling.

            When set to `true` along with `live=true`, the server will use SSE
            to stream updates to the client. SSE provides a persistent connection
            that allows the server to push updates as they happen, which is more
            efficient than long polling.

            SSE messages are sent in the standard SSE format with `data:` prefixes.
            The stream includes data messages (shape log entries), control messages
            (up-to-date, must-refetch, etc.), and keep-alive comments sent every
            21 seconds to prevent connection timeout.

            **Important**: SSE requires that reverse proxies and CDNs support
            streaming responses without buffering. Configure your proxy accordingly:
            - Nginx: `proxy_buffering off;`
            - Caddy: `flush_interval -1`
            - Apache: `flushpackets=on`

            SSE can only be enabled when `live` is also `true`.

            Optional where clause to filter rows in the `table`.

            This should be a valid PostgreSQL WHERE clause using SQL syntax.

            For more details on what is supported and what is optimal,
            see the [where clause documentation](https://electric-sql.com/docs/guides/shapes#where-clause).

            If this where clause uses a positional parameter, it's value must be provided under `params[n]=`
            query parameter.
          examples:
            title_filter:
              value: |
                "title = 'Electric'"

            Optional params to replace inside the where clause. Uses an "exploded object" syntax (see examples).

            These values will be safely interpolated inside the where clause, so you don't need to worry about
            escaping user input when building a where clause.

            If where clause mentions a posisional parameter, it becomes required to provide it.
          examples:
            params:
              value:
                1: value1

            type: string
          description: |-
            Optional list of columns to include in the rows from the `table`.

            They should always include the primary key columns, and should be formed
            as a comma separated list of column names exactly as they are in the database schema.

            If the identifier was defined as case sensitive and/or with special characters, then\
            you must quote it in the `columns` parameter as well.
          examples:
            select_columns:
              value: 'id,title,status'
              summary: Only include the id, title, and status columns.

            When set to `full` the entire row will be sent for updates and
            deletes. `old_value` will also be present on update messages,
            containing the previous value for changed columns.

          description: |-
            Controls the initial data loading mode for the shape.

            When `log=full` (the default), the server creates an initial snapshot
            of all data matching the shape definition and streams it to the client
            before delivering real-time updates.

            When `log=changes_only`, the server skips the initial snapshot creation.
            The client will only receive changes that occur after the shape is
            established, without seeing the base data. This is useful for:

            - Event streams where historical data isn't needed
            - Applications that fetch their initial state through `subset__*` parameters
            - Reducing initial sync time when combined with `offset=now`

            In `changes_only` mode, you can use the client's `requestSnapshot` method
            to fetch subsets of data on-demand while tracking which changes to skip.

            Optional WHERE clause to filter a subset of the shape data.

            Presence of this or other `subset__*` parameters in the request makes the server
            return a subset snapshot instead of the regular shape sync.

            This allows you to fetch a specific portion of the shape's data with
            additional filtering beyond the main shape's WHERE clause. This filter is
            always applied in addition to the main shape's WHERE clause, so it's not possible
            to get data that doesn't match the main shape's WHERE clause.

                  The schema object contains the type of the column, the number of dimensions, and possibly additional properties.
                  Non-array types have a dimension of `0`, while array types have a dimension of 1 or more.
                  For instance, an array of booleans would have a type of `bool` and a dimension of `1`.
                  Some types provide additional properties,
                  e.g.: `VARCHAR(8)` has an additional `“max_length": 8` property,
                        `BPCHAR(9)` has an additional `"length": 9` property,
                        `TIME(3)` has an additional `"precision": 3` property,
                        `NUMERIC(8,5)` has additional `"precision": 8` and `"scale": 5` properties,
                        `INTERVAL(4)` has an additional `"precision": 4` property,
                        `INTERVAL MINUTE TO SECOND` has an additional `"fields": "MINUTE TO SECOND"` property,
                        `BIT(5)` has an additional `"length": 5` property.

                This will not always be returned, as a new shape handle might not be immediately
                available at the point of invalidation of the current operation.

                If the replacement handle is not present, clients should attempt to use a
                consistent cache buster for their next `offset=-1` request to avoid running into
                the cached response for the invalidated shape.

                A suggested approach is to set the handle in the next `offset=-1` approach as the
                current shape's handle with a suffix like `-next` - the handle will be ignored
                by the server, and it can act as a consistent cache buster between clients.

      summary: Get Shape with Subset (POST)
      description: |-
        Request a subset snapshot using POST with parameters in the request body.

        **This is the recommended method for subset snapshots.** POST requests send
        subset parameters in the request body as JSON, avoiding URL length limits
        (HTTP 414 errors) that can occur with complex WHERE clauses or many parameters.

        This is particularly important for queries with large parameter lists, such as
        `WHERE id = ANY($1)` with hundreds of IDs (common in join queries).

        In Electric 2.0, GET requests for subset snapshots will be deprecated and
        only POST will be supported.

        The shape definition (`table`, `handle`, `offset`, etc.) is still provided
        as query parameters, while subset parameters (`where`, `params`, `limit`,
        `offset`, `order_by`) are provided in the JSON request body.
