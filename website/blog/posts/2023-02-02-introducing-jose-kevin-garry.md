We are fortunate to have the opportunity to collaborate with José, and tap his expertise to help bring our vision for local-first software development into reality!

Kevin De Porre is a world expert in mixed consistency and programming language design for distributed systems. His work includes [ECROs: Building Global Scale Systems from Sequential Code](https://youtu.be/UbwOlJTb-b4) and  [VeriFx: Correct Replicated Data Types for the Masses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02502). Kevin joins Electric having recently received his doctorate from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. We are extremely excited to bring Kevin's expertise on board and believe he will play a key role in defining the future of local-first software development.

Garry Hill is a highly experienced software developer and entrepreneur. He joins Electric from pioneering generative AI startup [Hazy](https://hazy.com/), which he took from zero to scale-up phase as Chief Technical Architect, with backing from investors including M12 and Notion Capital. As well as 30 years professional development experience and a passion for functional programming in Elixir, Garry brings a huge amount of engineering leadership and company building experience.

As we begin the new year with a growing team, please take a moment and join us in welcoming José, Kevin, and Garry!
