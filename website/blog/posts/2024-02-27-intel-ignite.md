ElectricSQL was selected by Intel as one of 10 startups to participate in [batch #6](https://intelignite.com/intel-ignite-selects-10-startups-for-fall-2023-european-cohort/) of it's [Intel Ignite](https://intelignite.com) accelerator programme in Munich.

It's a unique opportunity and our thanks go to [Alois](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alois-eder-013b0460/), [Kate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katehach/), [Markus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markusbohl/) and [Martha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martha-ivanovas-78a897b/) on the programme team.

The network around Ignite is unique and the other companies in the batch were all, without exception, exceptional. Doing everything from building fusion power reactors to next-generation chip manufacturing:

- [Deep Detection](https://deepdetection.tech) – high speed, multispectral analysis technology
- [Dotphoton](https://www.dotphoton.com) – massive-scale data processing and compression
- [FononTech](https://www.fonontech.com) – impulse printing of 3D interconnects for vertical chips
- [Giskard](https://www.giskard.ai) – testing and QA framework for AI
- [Proxima Fusion](https://www.proximafusion.com) – actually building stellarator fusion plants
- [Quantum Diamonds](https://www.quantumdiamonds.de) – quantum sensing for semiconductors
- [Semron](https://www.semron.ai) – high-density edge AI inference chip
- [SuperDuper](https://superduperdb.com) – bringing AI to the database
- [Zerve](https://www.zerve.ai) – reinventing data science collaboration

It was a privilege to be in the room.

We look forward to continuing the collaboration through the [Intel Liftoff](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/liftoff.html) programme, where we plan to integrate our [local-first sync engine](https://legacy.electric-sql.com/docs/intro/local-first) with the [Intel oneAPI stack](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/overview.html) to power the next generation of [local RAG applications](/blog/2024/02/05/local-first-ai-with-tauri-postgres-pgvector-llama) running on [Intel's vision of the AI PC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/core-ultra/ai-pc.html).
