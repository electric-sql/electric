# Electric Cloud Data Processing Addendum

This Data Processing Addendum (“**DPA**”) amends and forms part of the written agreement between Customer and Electric DB Inc. (further "**Electric**" or the “**Company**”) (collectively, “**the parties**”) pursuant to the Terms of Service or other agreement for the provision of services to the Customer (the “**Agreement**”). This DPA prevails over any conflicting term of the Agreement but does not otherwise modify the Agreement.

## Definitions

In this DPA:

“**Data Protection Law**” means all laws that apply to the Processing of Personal Data under the Agreement, including European Data Protection Law and the laws and regulations of the United States and its states, as amended from time to time, to the extent such laws and regulations apply to the relevant party.

“**European Data Protection Law**” means the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("**GDPR**") and all other privacy and data protection laws of the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), and their respective Member States, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (“**UK**”) and all laws implementing or supplementing the foregoing.

- “**Personal Data**” means any information that reasonably relates, directly or indirectly, to an identified or identifiable natural person that Company may Process on Customer’s behalf in performing the services under the Agreement.





“**Processing**” (including its cognate "**Process**”) means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.

“**Security Incident**” means a breach of security leading to the unauthorized or unlawful access by a third party, or confirmed accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, of Personal Data.

“**Standard Contractual Clauses**” means (i) Module 2 of the Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of Personal Data to third countries pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and the Council approved by European Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021, as currently set out at  (the “**EU SCCs**”), and (ii) where the UK GDPR applies, the EU SCCs as supplemented by the International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the Commissioner under S119A(1) Data Protection Act 2018 (the “**UK SCCs**”).

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning given to them in the Agreement.

## Scope and Roles

The subject matter, nature and purpose of the Processing, the types of Personal Data and categories of Data Subjects are set out in **Annex I**.

Company agrees that it will Process Personal Data only in accordance with the Agreement and this DPA. To the extent applicable, Company will Process Personal Data as a “processor” or “service provider” as such terms are defined under applicable Data Protection Law.

## Data Protection

When Company Processes Personal Data, it will:

Process the Personal Data in accordance with Customer's documented instructions as described in the Agreement or this DPA. Company will notify Customer if it considers that an instruction from Customer is in breach of Data Protection Law, unless it is prohibited from doing so by law on important grounds of public interest;

assist Customer, taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Company, in complying with Customer's obligations to respond to requests concerning Personal Data from individuals under applicable Data Protection Law;

implement and maintain appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, which include the technical and organizational measures required by applicable Data Protection Law;

only entrust the Processing of Personal Data to personnel who have undertaken to comply with confidentiality requirements; and

upon termination of the Agreement, as instructed by Customer, to the extent that Company retains Personal Data, permit Customer to delete or obtain copies of such Personal Data consistent with the functionality of the Services and applicable law.

- Company certifies that it will not (a) “sell” (as defined in Data Protection Law) the Personal Data; (b) share the Personal Data for “cross-context behavioral advertising” (as defined in Data Protection Law) (c) retain, use, combine or disclose the Personal Data for any purpose other than as permitted under this DPA and in accordance with the Agreement; or (d) retain, use, or disclose the Personal Data other than in the context of the direct relationship with Customer in accordance with the Agreement.

## Customer Responsibilities

5.1	Customer is responsible for the lawfulness of Personal Data processing under or in connection with the services. Customer will (i) provide all required notices and obtain all required consents, permissions and rights necessary under applicable Data Protection Law for Company to lawfully Process Personal Data for the purposes contemplated by the Agreement; (ii) make appropriate use of the services to ensure a level of security appropriate to the particular content of the Personal Data; (iii) comply with all Data Protection Law applicable to the collection of Personal Data and the transfer of such Personal Data to Company; and (iv) ensure its processing instructions comply with applicable laws (including applicable Data Protection Law).

## Subprocessing

Customer agrees that Company may use the third-party suppliers listed in on the Subprocessor List available at [ADD LINK] to Process Personal Data on its behalf for the provision of the services under the Agreement (each a “**Subprocessor**”).

Prior to authorizing any new Subprocessor to access Personal Data, Company will update the Subprocessor List. Updates to the Subprocessor List will be provided by email to account owners and by updating the Subprocessor List published as provided in Section 5.1 above. If Customer objects to the appointment of such Subprocessor within ten (10) days, it may terminate the portion of the services that cannot be provided without such Subprocessor on written notice to Company that includes Customer’s legitimate and documented grounds for non-approval.

Company will ensure that any Subprocessors to which it transfers Personal Data enter into written agreements with Company requiring that the Subprocessor abide by terms substantially similar to those contained in this DPA.

Company will remain liable for any breaches of this DPA caused by its Subprocessors.

## Restricted Data Transfers

In the event that Customer is subject to European Data Protection Law and the transfer of Personal Data to Company would be restricted in the absence of the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Parties agree that the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be incorporated into this DPA with Customer as the “data exporter” and Company as the “data importer.”

The Standard Contractual Clauses are further completed as follows: the optional docking clause in Clause 7 is implemented; Clause 9(a) option 2 is implemented and the time period therein is specified as thirty (30) days; the optional redress clause in Clause 11(a) is struck; the governing law in Clause 17 is the law of Ireland; the court in Clause 18(b) are the Courts of Ireland; and Annex 1, 2 and 3 to the Standard Contractual Clauses are Annex I and II and Section 5 of this DPA respectively. To the extent required by Data Protection Law in the UK, Part 1, tables 1, 2 and 3 of the UK SCCs will be deemed to be completed like its equivalent provisions in the EU SCCs. For the purpose of Part 1, Table 4, the party that may end the UK SCCs in accordance with Section 19 of the UK Addendum is the importer.

## Assistance and Notifications

Upon Customer’s request, Company will provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance to the extent required to fulfil Customer’s obligation under European Data Protection Law to:

reply to investigations and inquiries from data protection regulators; and

carry out a data protection impact assessment related to the services, where Client does not otherwise have access to the relevant information necessary to perform such assessment.

Unless prohibited by Data Protection Law, Company must inform Customer without undue delay if Company:

receives a request, complaint or other inquiry regarding the Processing of Personal Data;

receives a binding or non-binding request to disclose Personal Data from law enforcement, courts or any government body;

is subject to a legal obligation that requires Company to Process Personal Data in contravention of Customer’s instructions; or

is otherwise unable to comply with Data Protection Law or this DPA.

Upon becoming aware of a Security Incident, Company will inform Customer without undue delay and will provide timely information relating to the Security Incident as it becomes known or as is reasonably requested by Customer to allow Customer to fulfil its data breach reporting obligations under applicable Data Protection Law.

## Audit

Company will make available to Customer at Customer’s request information which is necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA and allow for any audits, including inspections, conducted by Customer or another auditor, as requested by Customer.

To the extent Company makes available to Customer confidential summary reports ("**Audit Report**") prepared by third-party security professionals, Customer agrees to accept such Audit Report, subject to confidentiality requirements, in satisfaction of its audit right; however, if Customer can demonstrate that it requires additional information, beyond the Audit Report, then Customer may request, at Customer's cost, Company to provide for an audit subject to reasonable confidentiality procedures, which will: (i) not include access to any information that could compromise confidential information relating to other Company customers or suppliers, Company's technical and organizational measures, or any trade secrets; and (ii) be performed upon not less than thirty (30) days’ notice, during regular business hours and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with Company’s normal business activities.

## General

If there is any conflict between this DPA and the Agreement, this DPA will prevail to the extent of that conflict in connection with the Processing of Personal Data.

If any provision of this DPA is found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision does not affect any other provision of this DPA and all provisions not affected by such invalidity or unenforceability will remain in full force and effect.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement or this DPA, the liability of each party under this DPA is subject to the limitations of liability set out in the Agreement.

This DPA will be governed by and construed in accordance with governing law and jurisdiction provisions in the Agreement.
