# Privacy

We provide open source software that you host yourself. We do not manage a service for you or host your data for you.

## Privacy policy

We request and store your personal information when you submit a contact or similar form on our website. We only ask you for personal information that's necessary to operate our business. We will always endeavour to protect your data and only collect and hold the minimum personal data required to operate our service.

Except for the following two cases, we will not sell or share your information with anyone else:

1. we may store your data in third party hosted CRM software, such as HubSpot, for the purposes of managing it and using it to communicate with you
2. we may disclose or transfer your data to a company that acquires or purchases a majority stake in us

## Data removal requests

Please email us on [privacy@electric-sql.com](mailto:privacy@electric-sql.com) if you would like us to destroy or provide your data.
