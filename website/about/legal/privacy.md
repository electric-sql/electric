This Privacy Policy also describes how we use and share that information, the choices you have, and how you can contact us if you have questions or concerns.

## Personal Information We Collect

**Information you provide to us may include**:

If you sign up for or login to the Services with a third-party service, you direct the third party to send us information (e.g., contact information) controlled by that service or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service. The information we receive when you authenticate through a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in the relevant third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with us.

**Content or data** you provide to us or permit us to access in the course of providing Services to you. For example, we may process any data or content you sync via Postgres and data written to or processed through durable streams and any other protocols supported by the Services.

**Cookie Policy
Last Updated**: [DATE]

This Cookie Policy explains how we use cookies and similar technologies. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

## 1. What are cookies and similar technologies?

**Cookies**. A cookie is a text file containing a string of characters that is sent to your device when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognise your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. Cookies set by the website owner are called "first party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

**Local storage. **Local storage technologies refer to the methods that web applications use to store data locally on your device. The most commonly used local storage technology is called "localStorage" and is part of the HTML5 standard. This technology allows web applications to store data that persists even after the user closes their browser or restarts their device.

**Session storage. **Session storage is a feature of your web browser that allows a website to temporarily store data on your device while you are actively using the website. This data is deleted as soon as you close your browser or navigate away from the website. Websites may use session storage to improve your experience and ensure that certain information is readily available during your browsing session.

**Other tracking technologies**. Websites use a variety of tracking technologies, including web beacons (also known as tracking pixels), third-party tracking scripts, advertising pixels, and analytics tools. These technologies provide data on how visitors use websites and allow websites to serve personalised advertisements.

This Cookie Policy refers to all these technologies collectively as “**cookies**.”

## 2. Why do we use cookies?

We use cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our website to operate, and we refer to these as "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website and services more broadly. For example, our cookies may help to distinguish you from other users of our services for the purposes of helping you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, helping us understand activity and patterns, and facilitating online advertising.

Third parties set cookies on our website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

## 3. How do we use cookies?

We, our service providers, and our advertising partners automatically log information about an individual’s interactions with our website and services, such as:

Device information, such as computer or mobile device operating system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU usage, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers (including identifiers used for advertising purposes), language settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., WiFi, LTE, 5G), and general location information such as city, state, or geographic area.

Online activity information, such as pages or screens viewed, how long individuals spend on a page or screen, the website they visited before browsing to our website, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about activity on a page or screen, access times and duration of access, and whether individuals open our marketing emails or click links within them.

We use both persistent cookies and session cookies. Persistent cookies stay on your device for a set period of time or until you delete them, while session cookies are deleted once you close your web browser. We use persistent cookies, for example, to remember any preferences you have or choices you make when you use our website.

## 4. What types of cookies do we use?

In this section, we outline the specific types of cookies served through our website and the purposes they serve.

These cookies include:

**Strictly necessary cookies**: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our website. They provide page navigation functionality and access to secure areas. You can set your browser to block these cookies, but then some parts of the services will not work.

**Functionality cookies**: These cookies enhance the performance of our website (e.g., they allow us to remember your preferences and settings). Without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.

**Performance cookies**: These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our website but are non-essential to their use. This website uses analytics cookies for these purposes and to measure, monitor and analyse use of our website.

## 5. How can you control cookies?
