You are a generalist and future founder. You want to join an existing, Seed-stage startup with product market fit to work directly with the founding team and learn how to grow a startup into and through the Series stages.

[Electric](/) is a devtools startup. We solve [reactive, real-time sync](/blog/2025/07/29/local-first-sync-with-tanstack-db) across client and server. We have a large developer community, millions of downloads a week, high profile customers and [top-tier investors](/about/team#investors), including the founders of companies like Supabase and Heroku. Our software is built into platforms like Firebase, Prisma and TanStack. Our cloud product is growing 7% week on week.

This is a hands-on, operational role. Your job will be to take over and manage as much of the company operations as you can. You'll work directly with [the founders and founding team](/about/team). Reporting to and working closely with the CEO. You must be the opposite of a prevaricator. You have to drive and get stuff done yourself. As the company grows, your role will grow. There is no ceiling here.

You'll handle everything and anything. From paying invoices, tracking metrics and organising events to marketing automation, customer success and solving scaling problems. You need to pick things up, handle them and then either resource or automate them. Everything is either a technology problem or a team design problem. With agents, those lines are blurring.

You're AI, media and business native and you're very comfortable with ambiguity and change. It's likely, but not essential, that you have a degree. You must have two years' professional experience including operational or project/programme management experience. Either at an early-stage startup or combined with strong evidence of having hustled projects or communities from zero to one.

It's a flexible, full time role. How you manage your time is flexible and you're welcome to organise your day around family or other life commitments. The constraints are that you'll be working with a remote team across the US and Europe. So you'll need some cross-over with European time and most of your time overlapping with Pacific Time.

It would be ideal if you're based in the San Francisco Bay Area. If not, you need to be able to travel there every month or so. You also need to travel to Europe for team on-sites a few times a year.

Travel and other work costs are obviously covered for you and we provide health insurance, 401(k) plan and generous PTO.
