## Stage

We're a Seed-stage [VC-backed](/about/team#investors) startup.

## Benefits

We work a 4 day week with flexible hours and no fetishisation of working late.

You get 25 days holiday + public holidays, equipment of your choice and a mandate to contribute to open source.

## Location

We're a remote-first team but we organise quarterly on-sites in Europe.

So far places we've met up in include Amsterdam, Dublin, Istanbul, Istria, Lisbon, London, Munich, Paris, Stockholm and Zagreb.

We especially welcome female applicants, applicants from ethnic groups that are under represented in tech and LGBTQ+ applicants.

We're happy for you to fit work around your children or other life commitments.
