## Stage

We're a Seed-stage [VC-backed](/about/team#investors) startup.

## Benefits

We work a 4 day week with flexible hours and no fetishisation of working late.

You get 25 days holiday + public holidays, equipment of your choice and a mandate to contribute to open source.

## Location

We're a remote-first team but we organise quarterly on-sites in Europe.

So far places we've met up in include Amsterdam, Dublin, Istanbul, Istria, Lisbon, London, Munich, Paris, Stockholm and Zagreb.

## Diversity

We especially welcome female applicants, applicants from ethnic groups that are under represented in tech and LGBTQ+ applicants.

We're happy for you to fit work around your children or other life commitments.
