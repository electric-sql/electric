# MobX

[MobX](https://mobx.js.org) is a framework for simple, scalable, client-side state management.

Electric can be integrated with MobX by syncing data into a [Shape](/docs/api/clients/typescript#shape) using the Typescript client and then [making the shape observable](https://mobx.js.org/observable-state.html).

## Help wanted <Badge type="tip" text="Good first issue" />

We have an [open GitHub issue tracking this](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/issues/1477) if you would like to contribute an example or library integrating Electric and MobX.
