# Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is an [application deployment platform](https://www.netlify.com/platform/).

## Electric and Netlify

Netlify is a great choice for deploying client-side web apps that use Electric.

> [!Tip] Need context?
> See the [Deployment guide](/docs/guides/deployment) for more details.

### Deploy your app

[Create your app](https://docs.netlify.com/welcome/add-new-site/), connect it to Netlify and [deploy via `git push`](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#deploy-with-git).

### Connect to Electric

> [!Warning] You need Electric (and Postgres) running somewhere else
> The easiest way is to use the [Electric Cloud](/product/cloud). Or see the [Deployment guide](/docs/guides/deployment).

Copy the URL to your Electric instance and use it when [syncing data](/docs/api/clients/typescript#shape) into your app. E.g.: by [setting an environment variable](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/get-started/#site-environment-variables) and using it in your code:

```tsx
const ELECTRIC_URL = process.env.ELECTRIC_URL

const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: `${ELECTRIC_URL}/v1/shape`,
  table: 'items'
})
```

See the [Client docs](/docs/api/clients/typescript) for more information.
