# LiveStore

[LiveStore](https://github.com/livestorejs) is a reactive SQLite-based state management library focused on high-performance client-side reactivity and high-quality DX. Originally based on [Riffle](https://riffle.systems), LiveStore is under active development by [Johannes Schickling](https://x.com/schickling).

ElectricSQL are sponsoring LiveStore development and building a first-class sync integration. This will be released when LiveStore is released (as public open-source code).

If you're interested in building with LiveStore now, [get in touch with us](/about/contact) or with Johannes directly.
