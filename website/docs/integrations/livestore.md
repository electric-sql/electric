# LiveStore

[LiveStore](https://github.com/livestorejs) is a reactive SQLite-based state management library focused on high-performance client-side reactivity, originally based on [Riffle](https://riffle.systems).

LiveStore is under active development by [Johannes Schickling](https://x.com/schickling).

## Electric and Livestore

ElectricSQL are sponsoring LiveStore development and building a sync integration. This will be released when LiveStore is released (as public open-source code).

## Early access

If you're interested in using LiveStore now, [get in touch](/about/contact) or contact Johannes directly.
