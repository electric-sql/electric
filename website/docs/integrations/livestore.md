# LiveStore

[LiveStore](https://github.com/livestorejs) is a reactive SQLite-based state management library focused on high-performance client-side reactivity, originally based on [Riffle](https://riffle.systems).

## Electric and LiveStore

LiveStore is under active development by [Johannes Schickling](https://www.schickling.dev). ElectricSQL are sponsoring LiveStore development and building a sync integration.

Some early docs are published at [livestore.dev](https://livestore.dev/getting-started/react-web). You can also see the [Expo](./expo) launch day [blog post](https://expo.dev/blog/local-first-application-development-with-livestore) and video:

## Early access

LiveStore is now open access for GitHub Sponsors.

You can get access by [sponsoring Johannes here](https://github.com/sponsors/schickling) for $20 per month.
