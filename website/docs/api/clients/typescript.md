# TypeScript client

The TypeScript client is a higher-level client interface that wraps the [HTTP API](/docs/api/http) to make it easy to sync [Shapes](/docs/guides/shapes) in the web browser and other JavaScript environments.

Defined in [packages/typescript-client](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/main/packages/typescript-client), it provides a [ShapeStream](#shapestream) primitive to subscribe to a change stream and a [Shape](#shape) primitive to get the whole shape whenever it changes.

## Install

The client is published on NPM as [`@electric-sql/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@electric-sql/client):

```sh
npm i @electric-sql/client
```

## How to use

The client exports:

- a [`ShapeStream`](#shapestream) class for consuming a [Shape Log](../http#shape-log); and
- a [`Shape`](#shape) class for materialising the log stream into a shape object

These compose together, e.g.:

```ts
import { ShapeStream } from '@electric-sql/client'

const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: `http://localhost:3000/v1/shape`,
  table: 'items'
})
const shape = new Shape(stream)

// The callback runs every time the Shape data changes.
shape.subscribe(data => console.log(data))
```

### ShapeStream

The [`ShapeStream`](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/blob/main/packages/typescript-client/src/client.ts#L163) is a low-level primitive for consuming a [Shape Log](../http#shape-log).

Construct with a shape definition and options and then either subscribe to the shape log messages directly or pass into a [`Shape`](#shape) to materialise the stream into an object.

```tsx
import { ShapeStream } from '@electric-sql/client'

// Passes subscribers rows as they're inserted, updated, or deleted
const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: `http://localhost:3000/v1/shape`,
  table: `foo`,
})

stream.subscribe(messages => {
  // messages is an array with one or more row updates
  // and the stream will wait for all subscribers to process them
  // before proceeding
})
```

#### Options

The `ShapeStream` constructor takes [the following options](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/blob/main/packages/typescript-client/src/client.ts#L39):

```ts
/**
 * Options for constructing a ShapeStream.
 */
export interface ShapeStreamOptions<T = never> {
  /**
   * The full URL to where the Shape is hosted. This can either be the Electric
   * server directly or a proxy. E.g. for a local Electric instance, you might
   * set `http://localhost:3000/v1/shape`
   */
  url: string

  /**
   * Which database to use.
   * This is optional unless Electric is used with multiple databases.
   */
  databaseId?: string

  /**
   * The root table for the shape. Passed as a query parameter. Not required if you set the table in your proxy.
   */
  table?: string

  /**
   * The where clauses for the shape.
   */
  where?: string

  /**
   * The columns to include in the shape.
   * Must include primary keys, and can only inlude valid columns.
   */
  columns?: string[]

  /**
   * The "offset" on the shape log. This is typically not set as the ShapeStream
   * will handle this automatically. A common scenario where you might pass an offset
   * is if you're maintaining a local cache of the log. If you've gone offline
   * and are re-starting a ShapeStream to catch-up to the latest state of the Shape,
   * you'd pass in the last offset and shapeId you'd seen from the Electric server
   * so it knows at what point in the shape to catch you up from.
   */
  offset?: Offset

  /**
   * Similar to `offset`, this isn't typically used unless you're maintaining
   * a cache of the shape log.
   */
  shapeId?: string

  /**
   * HTTP headers to attach to requests made by the client.
   * Can be used for adding authentication headers.
   */
  headers?: Record<string, string>

  /**
   * Additional request parameters to attach to the URL.
   * These will be merged with Electric's standard parameters.
   * Note: You cannot use Electric's reserved parameter names
   * (table, where, columns, offset, etc.).
   */
  params?: Record<string, string>

  /**
   * Automatically fetch updates to the Shape. If you just want to sync the current
   * shape and stop, pass false.
   */
  subscribe?: boolean

  /**
   * Signal to abort the stream.
   */
  signal?: AbortSignal

  /**
   * Custom fetch client implementation.
   */
  fetchClient?: typeof fetch

  /**
   * Custom parser for handling specific Postgres data types.
   */
  parser?: Parser<T>

  backoffOptions?: BackoffOptions
}
```

Note that certain parameter names are reserved for Electric's internal use and cannot be used in custom params:
- `table`
- `where`
- `columns`
- `offset`
- `handle`
- `live`
- `cursor`
- `database_id`
- `replica`

Attempting to use these reserved names will throw an error.

Example usage with custom headers and parameters:

```ts
const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/v1/shape',
  table: 'items',
  // Add authentication header
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer token'
  },
  // Add custom URL parameters
  params: {
    'tenant': 'acme-corp',
    'version': '1.0'
  }
})
```

#### Messages

A `ShapeStream` consumes and emits a stream of messages. These messages can either be a `ChangeMessage` representing a change to the shape data:

```ts
export type ChangeMessage<T extends Row<unknown> = Row> = {
  key: string
  value: T
  headers: Header & { operation: `insert` | `update` | `delete` }
  offset: Offset
}
```

Or a `ControlMessage`, representing an instruction to the client, as [documented here](../http#control-messages).

#### Parsing

By default, when constructing a `ChangeMessage.value`, `ShapeStream` parses the following Postgres types into native JavaScript values:

- `int2`, `int4`, `float4`, and `float8` are parsed into JavaScript `Number`
- `int8` is parsed into a JavaScript `BigInt`
- `bool` is parsed into a JavaScript `Boolean`
- `json` and `jsonb` are parsed into JavaScript values/arrays/objects using `JSON.parse`
- Postgres Arrays are parsed into JavaScript arrays, e.g. <code v-pre>"{{1,2},{3,4}}"</code> is parsed into `[[1,2],[3,4]]`

All other types aren't parsed and are left in the string format as they were served by the HTTP endpoint.

##### Custom parsing

You can extend this behaviour by configuring a custom parser. This is an object mapping Postgres types to parsing functions for those types. For example, we can extend the [default parser](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/blob/main/packages/typescript-client/src/parser.ts#L28-L37) to parse booleans into `1` or `0` instead of `true` or `false`:

```ts
const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: `http://localhost:3000/v1/shape`,
  table: `foo`,
  parser: {
    bool: (value: string) => value === `true` ? 1 : 0
  }
})
```

#### Replica full

By default Electric sends the modified columns in an update message, not the complete row. To be specific:

- an `insert` operation contains the full row
- an `update` operation contains the primary key column(s) and the changed columns
- a `delete` operation contains just the primary key column(s)

If you'd like to recieve the full row value for updates and deletes, you can set the `replica` option of your `ShapeStream` to `full`:

```tsx
import { ShapeStream } from "@electric-sql/client"

const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: `http://localhost:3000/v1/shape`,
  table: `foo`,
  replica: `full`,
})
```

This is less efficient and will use more bandwidth for the same shape (especially for tables with large static column values). Note also that shapes with different `replica` settings are distinct, even for the same table and where clause combination.

### Shape

The [`Shape`](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/blob/main/packages/typescript-client/src/shape.ts) is the main primitive for working with synced data.

It takes a [`ShapeStream`](#shapestream), consumes the stream, materialises it into a Shape object and notifies you when this changes.

```tsx
import { ShapeStream, Shape } from '@electric-sql/client'

const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: `http://localhost:3000/v1/shape`,
  table: `foo`,
})
const shape = new Shape(stream)

// Returns promise that resolves with the latest shape data once it's fully loaded
await shape.rows

// passes subscribers shape data when the shape updates
shape.subscribe(({ rows }) => {
  // rows is an array of the latest value of each row in a shape.
})
```

### Error handling

The TypeScript client provides several error classes to help you handle different types of errors that may occur:

```typescript
import { ShapeStream, FetchError, ReservedParamError } from '@electric-sql/client'

try {
  const stream = new ShapeStream({
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/v1/shape',
    table: 'items',
    params: {
      // This would throw a ReservedParamError as 'table' is reserved
      table: 'items'
    }
  })
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ReservedParamError) {
    console.error('Cannot use reserved parameter names:', error.message)
  } else if (error instanceof FetchError) {
    console.error('HTTP error:', error.status, error.message)
  }
}
```

#### Error classes

##### `FetchError`
Thrown when there's an HTTP error during shape fetching. Contains:
- `status`: HTTP status code
- `text`: Response text if available
- `json`: Parsed JSON response if available
- `headers`: Response headers
- `url`: Request URL

##### `FetchBackoffAbortError`
Thrown when a fetch with backoff is aborted using the AbortSignal.

##### `InvalidShapeOptionsError`
Thrown when the ShapeStream options are invalid (e.g., missing required URL).

##### `InvalidSignalError`
Thrown when the provided AbortSignal is not a valid AbortSignal instance.

##### `MissingShapeHandleError`
Thrown when a shape handle is required but not provided (e.g., when offset > -1).

##### `ReservedParamError`
Thrown when attempting to use Electric's reserved parameter names in custom params. Contains the list of conflicting parameter names.

##### `ParserNullValueError`
Thrown by the parser when attempting to parse a NULL value in a column that doesn't allow NULL values.

#### Error handling in subscribers

When subscribing to a ShapeStream or Shape, you can provide an error handler:

```typescript
const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/v1/shape',
  table: 'items'
})

stream.subscribe(
  (messages) => {
    // Handle messages
  },
  (error) => {
    if (error instanceof FetchError) {
      console.error('HTTP error:', error.status, error.message)
    } else {
      console.error('Other error:', error)
    }
  }
)
```
