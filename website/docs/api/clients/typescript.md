# TypeScript client

The TypeScript client is a higher-level client interface that wraps the [HTTP API](/docs/api/http) to make it easy to sync [Shapes](/docs/guides/shapes) in the web browser and other JavaScript environments.

Defined in [packages/typescript-client](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/main/packages/typescript-client), it provides a [ShapeStream](#shapestream) primitive to subscribe to a change stream and a [Shape](#shape) primitive to get the whole shape whenever it changes.

## Install

The client is published on NPM as [`@electric-sql/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@electric-sql/client):

```sh
npm i @electric-sql/client
```

## How to use

The client exports a `ShapeStream` class for getting updates to shapes on a row-by-row basis as well as a `Shape` class for getting updates to the entire shape.

### `ShapeStream`

```tsx
import { ShapeStream } from '@electric-sql/client'

// Passes subscribers rows as they're inserted, updated, or deleted
const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: `http://localhost:3000/v1/shape/foo`,
})

stream.subscribe(messages => {
  // messages is an array with one or more row updates
  // and the stream will wait for all subscribers to process them
  // before proceeding
})
```

#### Custom parsing

By default, `ShapeStream` parses the following Postgres types into native JavaScript values:
- `int2`, `int4`, `float4`, and `float8` are parsed into JavaScript `Number`
- `int8` is parsed into a JavaScript `BigInt`
- `bool` is parsed into a JavaScript `Boolean`
- `json` and `jsonb` are parsed into JavaScript values/arrays/objects using `JSON.parse`
- Postgres Arrays are parsed into JavaScript arrays, e.g. <code v-pre>"{{1,2},{3,4}}"</code> is parsed into `[[1,2],[3,4]]`

All other types aren't parsed and are left in the string format as they were served by the HTTP endpoint.

The `ShapeStream` can be configured with a custom parser that is an object mapping Postgres types to parsing functions for those types.
For example, we can extend the [default parser](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/blob/main/packages/typescript-client/src/parser.ts#L14-L22) to parse booleans into `1` or `0` instead of `true` or `false`:

```ts
const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: `http://localhost:3000/v1/shape/foo`,
  parser: {
    bool: (value: string) => value === `true` ? 1 : 0
  }
})
```

### `Shape`

```tsx
import { ShapeStream, Shape } from '@electric-sql/client'

const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: `http://localhost:3000/v1/shape/foo`,
})
const shape = new Shape(stream)

// Returns promise that resolves with the latest shape data once it's fully loaded
await shape.rows

// passes subscribers shape data when the shape updates
shape.subscribe(({ rows }) => {
  // rows is an array of the latest value of each row in a shape.
})
```
