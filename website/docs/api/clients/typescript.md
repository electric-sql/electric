# TypeScript client

The client is defined in [packages/typescript-client](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/main/packages/typescript-client). It provides [ShapeStream](#shapestream) and [Shape](#shape) primitives to stream and materialize shapes.

## Use cases

Real-time Postgres sync for modern apps.

Electric provides an [HTTP interface](/docs/api/http) to Postgres to enable a massive number of clients to query and get real-time updates to subsets of the database, called [Shapes](/docs/guides/shapes). In this way, Electric turns Postgres into a real-time database.

The TypeScript client helps ease reading Shapes from the HTTP API in the browser and other JavaScript environments, like edge functions and server-side JavaScript applications. It supports both fine-grained and coarse-grained reactivity patterns &mdash; you can subscribe to see every row that changes, or you can just subscribe to get the whole shape whenever it changes.

## Install

The client is published on NPM as [`@electric-sql/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@electric-sql/client):

```sh
npm i @electric-sql/client
```

## How to use

The client exports a `ShapeStream` class for getting updates to shapes on a row-by-row basis as well as a `Shape` class for getting updates to the entire shape.

### `ShapeStream`

```tsx
import { ShapeStream } from '@electric-sql/client'

// Passes subscribers rows as they're inserted, updated, or deleted
const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: `http://localhost:3000/v1/shape/foo`,
})

stream.subscribe(messages => {
  // messages is an array with one or more row updates
})
```

By default, `ShapeStream` parses the following Postgres types into native JavaScript values:
- `int2`, `int4`, `float4`, and `float8` are parsed into JavaScript `Number`
- `int8` is parsed into a JavaScript `BigInt`
- `bool` is parsed into a JavaScript `Boolean`
- `json` and `jsonb` are parsed into JavaScript values/arrays/objects using `JSON.parse`
- Postgres Arrays are parsed into JavaScript arrays, e.g. `"&#123;{1,2},{3,4}}"` is parsed into `[[1,2],[3,4]]`

All other types aren't parsed and are left in the string format as they were served by the HTTP endpoint.

The `ShapeStream` can be configured with a custom parser that is an object mapping Postgres types to parsing functions for those types.
For example, we can extend the [default parser](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/blob/main/packages/typescript-client/src/parser.ts#L14-L22) to parse booleans into `1` or `0` instead of `true` or `false`:

```ts
const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: `http://localhost:3000/v1/shape/foo`,
  parser: {
    bool: (value: string) => value === `true` ? 1 : 0
  }
})
```

### `Shape`

```tsx
import { ShapeStream, Shape } from '@electric-sql/client'

const stream = new ShapeStream({
  url: `http://localhost:3000/v1/shape/foo`,
})
const shape = new Shape(stream)

// Returns promise that resolves with the latest shape data once it's fully loaded
await shape.value

// passes subscribers shape data when the shape updates
shape.subscribe(shapeData => {
  // shapeData is a Map of the latest value of each row in a shape.
})
```
