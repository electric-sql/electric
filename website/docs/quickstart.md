# Quickstart

Let's make a super-fast, reactive web app <span class="no-wrap-xs">using [Electric](/product/electric) with [TanStack&nbsp;DB](/product/tanstack-db)</span>.

<div style="max-width: 632px">

> [!Warning] âœ¨ Just want to see it in action?
> See the [app running here](https://quickstart.examples.electric-sql.com) or [fork it on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/electric-sql/quickstart).

</div>

:::tabs
== Electric Cloud (default)

Run the starter script:

```shell
pnpx @electric-sql/start my-electric-app
```

This generates a [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) app in `my-electric-app` and runs a [Postgres database](https://electric-sql.com/docs/guides/deployment#_1-running-postgres) and an [Electric sync service](https://electric-sql.com/docs/guides/deployment#_2-running-electric) for you in the [Electric Cloud](/product/cloud).

You can then run the app locally using:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

Open in your web browser at [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
