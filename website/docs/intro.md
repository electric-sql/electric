# Documentation

Welcome to the ElectricSQL developer documentation!

ElectricSQL is a Postgres sync engine. Use it to sync [subsets](/docs/guides/shapes) of your Postgres data into [local apps](/use-cases/data-sync), services and [environments](/use-cases/dev-and-test).

> [!Warning] ðŸš€ Latest releases
> Electric is [now 1.0](/blog/2025/03/17/electricsql-1.0-released) and Cloud is now [in public BETA](/blog/2025/04/07/electric-cloud-public-beta-release)!

## New to ElectricSQL?

Start with the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) to get up-and-running. The guides on [Auth](/docs/guides/auth), [Shapes](/docs/guides/shapes) and [Writes](/docs/guides/writes) are also good entrypoints and helpful to understand how Electric works.

The [HTTP API](/docs/api/http) and [TypeScript Client](/docs/api/clients/typescript) docs show how to sync data. The [React](/docs/integrations/react) page illustrates how to bind these into a reactivity framework.

The easiest way to use Electric in production is the [Electric Cloud](/product/cloud). Alternatively, the [Deployment](/docs/guides/deployment) guide covers how to self host.

> [!warning] Looking for PGlite docs?
> If you're interested in using [PGlite](/product/pglite), it has it's own docs site at [pglite.dev/docs](https://pglite.dev/docs)

## Examples

See the [Demos](/demos) section and [`examples`](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/main/examples) folder on GitHub for demo apps and examples, e.g.:

<div class="demos-grid">
  <DemoListing :demo="aiChat"/>
  <DemoListing :demo="linearlite"/>
</div>

The integration docs also illustrate common patterns, e.g. using Electric with frameworks like [TanStack](/docs/integrations/tanstack) and [Phoenix](/docs/integrations/phoenix) and platforms like [Supabase](/docs/integrations/supabase) and [Cloudflare](/docs/integrations/cloudflare).
