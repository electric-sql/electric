# Documentation

Welcome to the ElectricSQL developer documentation!

ElectricSQL is a Postgres sync engine. Use it to sync [little subsets](/docs/guides/shapes) of your Postgres data into [local apps](/use-cases/state-transfer), services and [environments](/use-cases/dev-and-test).

You don't need to be an expert in database replication or distributed systems to use Electric. You do need to be familiar with basic web development.

## New to ElectricSQL?

Start with the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) to get up-and-running. The guides on [Shapes](/docs/guides/shapes) and [Auth](/docs/guides/auth) are also good entrypoints and helpful to understand how Electric works.

The [HTTP API](/docs/api/http) and [TypeScript Client](/docs/api/clients/typescript) docs show how to sync data. The [React](/docs/integrations/react) page illustrates how to bind these into a reactivity framework.

The easiest way to use Electric in production is the [Electric Cloud](/product/cloud). Alternatively, the [Deployment](/docs/guides/deployment) guide covers how to self host.

> [!warning] Looking for PGlite docs?
> If you're interested in using [PGlite](/product/pglite), it has it's own docs site at [pglite.dev/docs](https://pglite.dev/docs)

## Examples

There are lots of [examples](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/main/examples) in the main repo on GitHub.

The integration docs also illustrate common patterns, e.g. using Electric with frameworks like [TanStack](/docs/integrations/tanstack) and [Phoenix](/docs/integrations/phoenix) and platforms like [Supabase](/docs/integrations/supabase) and [Cloudflare](/docs/integrations/cloudflare).

## Source code

ElectricSQL is an open source project developed at [github.com/electric-sql](https://github.com/electric-sql). Check out the source code, issues and development in progress there.
