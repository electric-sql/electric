# Documentation

Welcome to the ElectricSQL developer documentation!

ElectricSQL is a sync engine. Use it to sync [little subsets](/docs/guides/shapes) of your Postgres data into [local apps](/use-cases/state-transfer), services and [environments](/use-cases/dev-and-test).

You don't need to be an expert in database replication or distributed systems to use Electric. You do need to be familiar with basic web development.
