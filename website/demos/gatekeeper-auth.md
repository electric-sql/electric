## Gatekeeper auth with Electric

This example demonstrates a number of ways of implementing the [gatekeeper auth](/docs/guides/auth#gatekeeper-auth) pattern for [securing access](/docs/guides/auth) to the [Electric sync service](/product/electric).

The Gatekeeper pattern works as follows:

1. post to a gatekeeper endpoint in your API to generate a shape-scoped auth token
2. make shape requests to Electric via an authorising proxy that validates the auth token against the request parameters

  </a>
</figure>

The auth token should include a claim containing the shape definition. This allows the proxy to authorize the shape request by comparing the shape claim signed into the token with the [shape defined in the request parameters](/docs/quickstart#http-api).

This keeps your main auth logic:

- in your API (in the gatekeeper endpoint) where it's natural to do things like query the database and call external services
- running *once* when generating a token, rather than on the "hot path" of every shape request in your authorising proxy
