## Linearlite using Electric and PGlite

<DemoEmbed :demo="$frontmatter" />

This demonstrates a fully-interactive, offline capable, real-world app with a large data set. It shows both fast initial data loading and instant local reactivity, despite a very large data set loaded into the local database.

Writes are handled using [through the DB sync](/docs/guides/writes#through-the-db) with sophisticated merge logic. See the [`README` in the example folder](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/main/examples/linearlite) for more information.
