Upgrade `@durable-streams/state` to `0.3.1` and drop the `@tanstack/db` pnpm override.

`@durable-streams/state@0.3.x` makes `@tanstack/db` an optional peer dependency (it was a direct `^0.6.0` dependency) and splits its tsdb-coupled tools into a `@durable-streams/state/db` subpath. tsdb-specific imports (`createStreamDB`, `queryOnce`, `createTransaction`, query operators, etc.) now come from `@durable-streams/state/db`; the bare entry keeps only the tsdb-free types and helpers.

Because state no longer pulls its own `@tanstack/db` copy, the root `pnpm.overrides` collapsing `@tanstack/db@>=0.6.0 <0.7.0` to `0.6.7` is removed. To keep a single `0.6.7` instance without it, `@tanstack/react-db` is raised to `^0.1.85` and `@tanstack/electric-db-collection` to `^0.3.5` (both pin `@tanstack/db@0.6.7`), and `@durable-streams/server` to `^0.3.7` (depends on `state@0.3.1`, removing the lingering transitive `state@0.2.9`).
