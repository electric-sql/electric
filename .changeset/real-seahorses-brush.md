Fixed the client not being able to reconnect if the migrations were preloaded and the only operation was a subscription. In that case the client have never received any LSNs (because migrations didn't need to be sent), so reconnection yielded errors due to missing LSN but existing previously fulfilled subscriptions. We now send the LSN with the subscription data so even if it's the first and only received message, the client has enough information to proceed.
