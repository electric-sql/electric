Harden pull-wake runner lifecycle with a state machine, heartbeat-driven stream resets, and exponential reconnect backoff (1s-30s). Add granular `status` field to `PullWakeRunnerHealth` (`stopped | starting | connecting | streaming | reconnecting | stopping`). The `onError` callback is now reporting-only (`(Error) => void`) - it can no longer control runner lifecycle. `stop()` rethrows `drainWakes` errors so callers observe wake handler failures. Event-driven heartbeat throttling avoids stale diagnostics between fixed-interval heartbeats. Durable Streams clients now append stream and `__ds` subscription control paths to the configured backend URL prefix without inferring a `/v1/stream` layout, so pull-wake subscriptions work behind arbitrary DS backend prefixes. Remove the stale `StreamClient.getConsumerState()` helper for the old Durable Streams `/consumers` endpoint.
