Fixed calls to the `.sync()` function when page reloads establishing a new subscription alongside existing one. Now we deduplicate subscription requests by hash of their contents, so no two exactly the same subscriptions are possible. This also solves calling `<table>.sync()` many times in multiple components - they will return the same promise.
