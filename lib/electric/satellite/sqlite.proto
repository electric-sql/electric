// This file defines protobuf protocol for SQLite Tcp Server
// Messages are send other the wire in the followng format:
//
// Size:32, MsgType:8, Msg/binary
//
// In this document there is a notation of the Client/Server and
// Producer/Consumer which are used to annotate messages.
//
// Server is expected to be one of the Electric instances, while Client is a
// client application that talks to Electric via Satellite library, or any other
// enitty that implements this protocol.
//
// Producer and Consumer are the corresponding roles Client and Server play in
// replication process. Consumer requests replication from the Producer, and
// periodically answer Ping requests form the Prodicer to acknowledge
// successfull replication. Consumer may also send such Ping requests, if the
// bidirectional replication is enabled. If one of the parties is not involved
// in the replication lsn field may be left empty.
