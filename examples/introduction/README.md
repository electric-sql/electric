# ElectricSQL Introduction

This repo contains the source code for the demo apps / widgets on the [Introduction section](https://electric-sql.com/docs/intro/local-first) of the [ElectricSQL website](https://electric-sql.com).

## Usage

Install deps:

```sh
yarn
```

Start the electric service, migrate, and generate the client:

```sh
yarn backend:up
yarn db:migrate
yarn client:generate
```

If running outside of the context of the website repo, you will need to populate some environment variables in `src/config.ts`. These are normally injected by Webpack during the website build but this source repo uses Vite as its build process.

Boot up the dev server

```sh
yarn dev
```

You should be able to see the website demo widgets in an unstyled page at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

If you see API request failures in the browser console, that's expected when this example is running outside of the context of the (private) website repo. These are meant to be integrated within the codebase of the website repo that powers https://electric-sql.com.
