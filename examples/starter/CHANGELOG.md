## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d109a1e7: Major new release that introduces Electric Postgres Proxy, affecting all Electric components.

### Patch Changes

- 23d84eb6: Update the `db:psql` script to connect to the database using `psql` running inside of the postgres container.

  This lifts the requirement of having a Postgres client installed on the host OS.

- e5fb598a: Expose port 65432 used by the proxy and make it configurable. Modify the migration machinery to go through the proxy. Modify the starter template to use the new `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ELECTRIC` syntax.
- cfded697: Modify CLI to introspect Postgres database through Electric's proxy.
- dc1c576e: The starter app can now have multiple migrations and applying them with `yarn db:migrate` is now idempotent.
- 0d879a88: Improved starter such that several (independent) Electric projects can run concurrently.
  The starter now has 2 modes: fast mode and interactive mode.
  In fast mode, you can provide the app name and optional ports for Electric and the webserver as arguments.
  In interactive mode, the script will prompt for an app name and ports (suggesting defaults).
  Port clashes are now detected and reported to the user.
  The user can change the ports the app uses by invoking 'yarn ports:configure'.
  Also fixes the bug where all Electric applications would forward requests to the esbuild server that is running on port 8000 instead of their own esbuild server.
