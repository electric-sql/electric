# ElectricSQL Starter App

This is a starter app template. You can use it to generate an ElectricSQL application with front and backend components. The app is setup to match the example code you can see in the [Quickstart](https://electric-sql.com/docs/quickstart).

## Pre-reqs

- Docker (with Compose V2)
- Node >=16.11.0

## Usage

Generate your start app. The first argument is used as the name of your app and the name of the folder to create:

```sh
npx create-electric-app my-app
```

Change directory into the created folder (`./my-app` in the example command above) and then follow the instructions in the generated README.
