This is a starter app template. You can use it to generate an ElectricSQL application. The app is setup to match the example code you can see in the [Quickstart](https://electric-sql.com/docs/quickstart).

## Pre-reqs

- Docker (with Compose V2)
- Node >= 16.11.0

## Usage

```sh
npx create-electric-app@latest my-app
```

Change directory into the created folder (`./my-app` in the example command above) and then follow the instructions in the generated README.
