# Welcome to your ElectricSQL app!

Start the backend:

```shell
yarn backend:start
```

Open a new tab in your terminal. Navigate back to the same folder. Apply the migrations (defined in `./db/migrations`):

```shell
yarn db:migrate
```

Generate your client:

```sh
yarn client:generate
```

Start your app:

```sh
yarn start
```

Open [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your web browser.

## Changing your database schema

You can watch for database schema changes and automatically generate a new client using:

```sh
yarn client:watch
```

## Notes

- `yarn backend:start` uses Docker Compose to start Postgres and the [Electric sync service](https://electric-sql.com/docs/api/service). See [running the examples](https://electric-sql.com/docs/examples/notes/running#running-your-own-postgres) for information about configuring the Electric sync service to run against an existing Postgres database.
- `yarn client:watch` calls `npx electric-sql generate --watch` under the hood. See [https://electric-sql.com/docs/api/generator](https://electric-sql.com/docs/api/generator) for more details.
