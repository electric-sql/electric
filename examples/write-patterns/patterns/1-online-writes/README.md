# Online writes pattern

This is an example of an application using:

- Electric for read-path sync, to sync data from into a local app
- online writes to write data back into Postgres from the local app

It's the simplest of the [write-patterns](https://electric-sql.com/docs/guides/writes#patterns) introduced in the [Writes](https://electric-sql.com/docs/guides/writes#patterns) guide.

> [!TIP] Other examples
> The [Phoenix LiveView example](../../../phoenix-liveview) also implements this pattern &mdash; using Electric to stream data into the LiveView client and normal Phoenix APIs to handle writes.

## Benefits

It's very simple to implement. It allows you [use your existing API](https://electric-sql.com/blog/2024/11/21/local-first-with-your-existing-api). It allows you to create apps that are fast and available offline for reading data.

Good use-cases include:

- live dashboards, data analytics and data visualisation
- AI applications that generate embeddings in the cloud
- systems where writes require online integration anyway, e.g.: making payments

## Drawbacks

You have the network on the write path â€” slow, laggy, loading spinners.

Interactive applications won't work offline without implementing [optimistic writes with local optimistic state](../2-optimistic-state).

## How to run

See the [How to run](../../README.md#how-to-run) section in the example README.
