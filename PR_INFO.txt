PR TITLE:
Add write_concurrency to ShapeStatus ETS tables

PR BODY:
Enables `write_concurrency: true` on ShapeStatus LastUsedTable and MetaTable to reduce lock contention during concurrent shape operations.

## Problem
ShapeStatus tables experience high concurrent write activity:
- 5-50+ API clients updating timestamps via `await_snapshot_start()`
- 10-20+ consumers updating offsets/xmins during transaction processing
- Shape deletes blocked waiting for global write lock
- Performance degradation with large numbers of shapes

## Solution
Add `write_concurrency: true` to both ShapeStatus tables since they have:
- Multiple concurrent writers to distributed keys (different shape_handle per operation)
- High write frequency under load
- No hot key contention

## Expected Impact
- Faster shape deletion operations
- Better scalability with increasing concurrent shapes
- Reduced lock contention on API operations
