:::caution Limitations
ElectricSQL is still in [early stage development](../../reference/limitations.mdx). Known limitations include:

- [additive migrations](./migrations.mdx#additive-migrations) only
- limited [data types](./migrations.mdx#data-types)
- limited [constraints](./migrations.mdx#constraints)
- [DDLX rules](../../api/ddlx.mdx) limited to [electrification with function call syntax](../../reference/limitations.mdx#ddlx-rules)
:::

ElectricSQL syncs data between a [central Postgres and local-first apps](../../intro/active-active.mdx).

The Postgres data model is used as the shared schema and the source of authorisation for what data is *allowed* to sync where.
