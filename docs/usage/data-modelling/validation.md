:::caution Work in progress
User input validation is not currently supported.

## Roadmap

Validation will be defined using [check constraints](./constraints.md#check-constraints) and [DDLX rules](../../api/ddlx.md). Validation logic will then be compiled to run both in the [Client](../data-access/client.md) and on the server.
