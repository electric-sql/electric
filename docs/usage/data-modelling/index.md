ElectricSQL syncs data between a [central Postgres and local-first apps](../../intro/active-active.md).

The Postgres data model is used as the shared schema and the source of authorisation for what data is *allowed* to sync where.

:::caution Work in progress
We're currently working on permissions, validation and support for additional types and constraints. See the pages below and the [Roadmap](../../reference/roadmap.md) for more information.
