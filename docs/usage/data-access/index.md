ElectricSQL generates a [type-safe data access library](./client.md) from the [electrified subset](../data-modelling/electrification.md) of your [Postgres data&nbsp;model](../data-modelling/migrations.md). This section explains how to generate this [Client library](./client.md) and how to use it to [sync data](./shapes.md) onto the local device and then [read](./queries.md) and [write](./writes.md) data locally.

:::note
If you're new to the ElectricSQL system you can [walk through the Introduction](../intro/local-first) to see how things fit together.
