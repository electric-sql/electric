Shapes are the core primitive for controlling sync in the ElectricSQL system.

Local apps establish shape subscriptions. This syncs data from the cloud onto the local device using the [Satellite replication protocol](../../api/satellite.md), into the local embedded database. Once the initial data has synced, [queries](./queries.md) can run against it.

The [Electric sync service](../installation/service.md) maintains shape subscriptions and streams any new data and data changes onto the local device. In this way, local devices can sync a sub-set of a larger database for interactive offline use.

Local apps ask the server for a specific set of related data that gets synced to the device. The central Postgres instance will often have too much data to fit on any one device, so shapes allow us to sync only a required subset of data onto the device. There is a balance between local data availability and storage usage on the device that is unique to every application, and shapes allow you to balance those properties while maintaining required guarantees.

:::caution Work in progress
Shapes are being actively developed, there is a list of [limitations](#limitations-and-issues) at the bottom of the page.
:::

## What is a shape?

A shape is a set of related data that's synced onto the local device. It is defined by:

- a **root table**, in your [electrified DDL schema](../data-modelling/electrification.md), such as `projects`
- a **query**, with where clauses used to filter the rows in that table
- an **include tree**, a directed acyclic graph of related data

For example, this `sync` call causes a project and all its issues, their comments and comment authors to sync atomically onto the local device:

```js
await db.projects.sync({
  where: {
    id: 'abcd'
  },
  include: {
    issues: {
      include: {
        comments: {
          include: {
            author: true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Once the data has synced onto the local device, it's kept in sync using a **shape subscription**. This monitors the replication stream and syncs any new data, updates and deletions onto the local device for as long as the shape's [subscription and retention semantics](#subscription-and-retention-semantics) define.

## Syncing shapes

ElectricSQL syncs shapes using the [`sync`](../../api/clients/typescript.md#sync) client function. You can sync individual rows:

```ts
await db.projects.sync({
  where: {
    id: 'abcd'
  }
})
```

You can sync filtered sets of rows:

```ts
await db.projects.sync({
  where: {
    status: 'active'
  }
})
```

You can sync deep nested shapes, such as an individual project with its related content and some filtering over that content

```ts
await db.projects.sync({
  where: {
    id: 'abcd'
  },
  include: {
    issues: {
      where: { status: { not_in: ['backlog'] } },
      include: {
        comments: {
          include: {
            author: true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Filter clauses

You can filter requested data by specifying a `where` clause while requesting a shape. `where` clauses can filter top-level rows, as well as any rows that come from following a one-to-many relation (see last example above). Shape `where` clauses may be either an object, or a string. They may only reference the columns on the filtered table itself.

It's important to note that many-to-one relations cannot be filtered that way (e.g. you cannot do `comments: { include: { author: { where { id: true }}}}`), because if a
target row would be filtered out, that would break FK consistency on the client.

This filter will apply to both initial data, and ongoing replication, with related data being pulled in or removed accordingly. For example, for `{projects: {where: {status: 'public'}, include: {issues: true}}}` shape, if there is an update that changes a project status to `public`, then that project will be synced to the device along with all the issues in that newly visible project. If a project changes status to, say, `private`, then the issues from that project will be gone from the device along with the project itself. There are some nuances to that part of the sync, which are described under the [move-in lag](#move-in-lag) section.

#### Object `where` clause

:::caution Work in progress
The TypeScript type of the object accepted in `.sync` call may be wider than what is actually supported.
:::

When filtering using an object, you can use Prisma-like syntax. Direct value comparisons are supported, as well as the following filtering functions:

- `equals`
- `in`
- `not`
- `notIn`
- `lt`
- `lte`
- `gt`
- `gte`
- `startsWith`
- `endsWith`
- `contains`

They can be combined as multiple parts of the same clause, and explicitly using:

- `AND`
- `OR`
- `NOT`

For example:

```ts
await db.projects.sync({
  where: {
    status: {
      in: ['active', 'pending']
    }
  }
})
```

See the <DocPageLink path="api/clients/typescript" /> docs for more details.

#### String `where` clause

:::note Work in progress
String `where` clause is currently only supported as top-level filtering. This will be fixed in a future release.
:::

You can use string `where` clauses that are plain SQL comparisons. You can use the usual PostgreSQL syntax, although not all functions are supported. The filtering expression is expected to evaluate to a boolean value. The columns of the table you're filtering can be referenced using `this.` prefix:

```ts
await db.projects.sync({
  where: "this.status IN ('active', 'pending')"
})
```

This allows for more flexibility as the Prisma-like does not support the all possible expressions supported by the Electric sync engine. However, you need to be more careful with interpolating your own values in the string to ensure that PostgreSQL would accept for the expected type.

```ts
await db.projects.sync({
  where: "lower(this.status) ~~ 'pending%'"
})
```

Full current list of supported Postgres functions and operators is easiest found [in code](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/blob/main/components/electric/lib/electric/replication/eval/env/known_functions.ex), but here's a gist:

- Types (input, comparison): all numerics, `bool`, `uuid`, `text`, all date/times apart from `timetz`
- Numeric functions: all basics + bitwise operations
- String functions: concatenation, `LIKE`/`ILIKE`
- Date functions: comparisons, intervals, `AT TIME ZONE` functions

:::note Work in progress
More basic type filtering support is being added, as well as more functions over those types.
:::

:::warning Limitation
The current filtering implementation does not support non-deterministic functions. For example it's not possible to use the PostgreSQL `now()` function in the where clause.
:::

### Promise workflow

The [`sync`](../../api/clients/typescript.md#sync) function resolves to an object containing a promise:

1. the first `sync()` promise resolves when the shape subscription has been confirmed by the server (the sync service)
2. the second `synced` promise resolves when the data in the shape has fully synced onto the local device

```tsx
// Resolves once the shape subscription
// is confirmed by the server.
const shape = await db.projects.sync()

// Resolves once the initial data load
// for the shape is complete.
await shape.synced
```

If the shape subscription is invalid, the first promise will be rejected. If the data load fails for some reason, the second promise will be rejected.

### Data loading

Data synced onto the local device via a shape subscription appears atomically in the local database. I.e.: it all loads within a single transaction.

You can query the local database at any time, for example, establishing a [Live query](./queries.md#live-queries) at the same time as initiating the shape sync. The query results will initially be empty (unless data is already in the local database) and then will update once with the full set of data loaded by the shape subscription.

For example, this is OK:

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { db } = useElectric()!
  const { results } = useLiveQuery(db.projects.liveMany())

  // console.log('MyComponent rendering')
  // console.log('results', results)

  const syncProjects = async () => {
    // console.log('syncProjects')

    const shape = await db.projects.sync()
    // console.log('shape subscription confirmed')

    await shape.synced
    // console.log('shape data synced')
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    syncProjects()
  }, [])

  return <h1>{results.length}</h1>
}
```

Or you can explicitly wait for the sync, for example, by conditionally rendering a child component once `shape.synced` has resolved:

```tsx
const MyContainer = () => {
  const { db } = useElectric()!
  const [ready, setReady] = useState(false)

  // console.log('MyContainer rendering')
  // console.log('ready', ready)

  const syncProjects = async () => {
    // console.log('syncProjects')

    const shape = await db.projects.sync()
    // console.log('shape subscription confirmed')

    await shape.synced
    // console.log('shape data synced')

    setReady(true)
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    syncProjects()
  }, [])

  if (!ready) {
    return null
  }

  return <MyComponent />
}

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { db } = useElectric()!
  const { results } = useLiveQuery(db.projects.liveMany())

  // console.log('MyComponent rendering')
  // console.log('results', results)

  return <h1>{results.length}</h1>
}
```

For many applications you can simply define the data you want to sync up-front, for example, at app load time and then just code against the local database once the data has synced in. For others, you can craft more dynamic partial replication, for instance, syncing data in as the user navigates through different routes or parts of the app.

## Limitations and issues

Shape-based sync is under active development, and we're aware of some issues with it. We're working on fixing the bugs and lifting limitations as we go.

- [`.sync`](../../api/clients/typescript.md#sync) method has a wider type signature in TypeScript than what's really supported. In particular, `limit`, `sort` and other keywords under `include` should not be there.
- `DELETE` of the top row on the client without having synced all the children may not result in a `DELETE` on the server and the row will be restored
- Recursive and mutually recursive tables are not supported at all for now. A foreign key loop will prevent the shape subscription from being established.
- Shape unsubscribe is not available, which means any shape subscription established by calling `.sync()` (in development in particular) is going to be statefully persisted regardless of code changes.

### Foreign key and query consistency

ElectricSQL maintains foreign key consistency both in the PostgreSQL central database, and in the local database on the client. To achieve it, the server will automatically follow any many-to-one relation in the requested shape. For example, if there are projects each with an owner and related issues, requesting all projects will also ensure that users who are owners of those projects are available on the device too. However, related issues won't show up on the device unless explicitly requested.

#### Updating shapes

:::danger Potential foot-gun in development
We're working to fix this limitation
:::

Once a subscription is established, it remains statefully in the local database even when you change the code. For example, doing `db.projects.sync({ where: { id: 1 }})`, starting the application, then changing the code to `db.projects.sync({ where: { id: 2 }})` will result in **2 subscriptions** established, with both projects synced to the device. We're working on lifting this limitation.

#### Unsubscribe not available

Related to the previous heading, removing a subscription to an existing shape is not supported yet. This will be available, lifting the previous limitation as well.

#### Move-in lag

Due to consistency considerations, when additional rows move into a shape as a result of following a one-to-many relation these will show up on the device slightly later than the parent row itself. It's important to keep this in mind when designing the UI.

For example, with this this shape:

```ts
await db.projects.sync({
  where: { status: 'active' },
  include: { issues: true }
})
```

If a project were to have its status changed to `active`, the client would now be eligible to see it, along with its issues. However, the project will be synced to the local database before the issues.

Please note that while we're going to improve developer experience around this aspect of syncing, this "lag" is part of the current consistency model.

:::note Work in progress
We expect to add client-side hooks notifying of such move-in events so that UI has more information to act upon.
:::

## Future capabilities

Shape-based sync is under active development. We aim soon to provide additional capabilities and primitives, such as the ones outlined below.

### Segmentation indexes

When a shape subscription is established, the initial data load (the rows in the shape) are fetched by a Postgres query. However, ongoing changes from the replication stream are mapped into shapes by the Electric sync service.

This limits the expressiveness of shape filter clauses to the matching capabilities of the sync service (as opposed to the full query capabilities of Postgres). Segmentation indexes are a mechanism to pre-define virtual columns as user-defined functions in the Postgres database, in order to support abitrary query logic in shape definitions.

### Subscription and retention semantics

Currently all shapes are always live. However, in some cases, you may want to make ephemeral queries and keep results available for offline use without always keeping them live and up-to-date. Subscription semantics will allow you to configure whether a shape subscription is maintained to keep the data synced in a shape live or not.

Currently all synced data is retained forever until explicitly deleted. Retention semantics will provide a declarative API to control data retention and deterministic behaviour when there's contention for storage resources.

### Discovered shapes

Many applications need to provide listings and search capabilities. You don't always want to sync the whole search index or table onto the local device to support this.

Discovery queries allow you to "discover" the results of a query run server-side on Postgres and to then subscribe to the query results. This allows you to keep a shape subscription live for a search or listing query.

### Derived shapes

Derived shapes are shapes that are derived from a component hierarchy. They are analogous to the way that fragments are aggregated into a top-level query by the Relay compiler.
