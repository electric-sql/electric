ElectricSQL generates a [type-safe data access library](./client.mdx) from the [electrified subset](../data-modelling/electrification.mdx) of your [Postgres data&nbsp;model](../data-modelling/migrations.mdx). This section explains how to generate this [Client library](./client.mdx) and how to use it to [sync data](./shapes.mdx) onto the local device and then [read](./queries.mdx) and [write](./writes.mdx) data locally.

:::note
If you're new to the ElectricSQL system you can [walk through the Introduction](../intro/local-first) to see how things fit together.
