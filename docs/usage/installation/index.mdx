import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList'

To use ElectricSQL, you need to

1. have [NodeJS](./prereqs.mdx#nodejs) and either [Docker](./prereqs.mdx#docker) or [Elixir](./prereqs.mdx#elixir)
1. have a [Postgres database](./postgres.mdx) with logical replication enabled
2. run the [Electric sync service](./service.mdx)
3. generate the [Typescript client](./client.mdx)

:::note
If you're looking for a quick way to get up and running, you can use the `create-electric-app` starter template [described in the Quickstart](../../quickstart/index.mdx?setup=generator).
