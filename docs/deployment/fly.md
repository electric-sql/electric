You can deploy ElectricSQL to [Fly.io](https://fly.io) and use either an external Postgres or an instance of Fly Postgres as the database for the sync service. This guide covers both scenarios:

  1. deploying the Electric sync service and connecting it to an external Postgres
  2. configuring Fly Postgres and the Electric sync service to connect over Fly's private network

:::info
For background on how to successfully deploy the sync service and what needs to connect where, see <DocPageLink path="deployment/concepts" />.

## Deploying Electric connected to an external Postgres

Before deploying Electric, you'll need a Postgres database (with logical replication enabled) hosted somewhere Electric can connect to. Many managed database providers support logical replication, see <DocPageLink path="usage/installation/postgres#hosting" /> for some options. Retrieve your database's connection URI with password included from your provider and use it as the value of the `DATABASE_URL` variable when setting up the app.

### Configure your Fly app

The app config needs to include an `http_service` with internal port `5133` and a TCP service for Electric's [migrations proxy](../usage/data-modelling/migrations#migrations-proxy) that listens on port `65432` by default.  See <DocPageLink path="api/service" /> to learn about the environment variables used by Electric in detail.

Save the following snippet into a file named `fly.toml` somewhere on your computer, changing the `app` name as you see fit:

```toml
app = "electric-on-fly-test-app"

[build]
  image = "electricsql/electric:latest"

[env]
  AUTH_MODE = "insecure"
  DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://..."
  ELECTRIC_WRITE_TO_PG_MODE = "direct_writes"
  PG_PROXY_PASSWORD = "proxy_password"

# The main Internet-facing service of Electric
# to which clients will be connecting.
[http_service]
  internal_port = 5133
  force_https = true

  [[http_service.checks]]
    interval = "10s"
    timeout = "1s"
    grace_period = "20s"
    method = "GET"
    path = "/api/status"

# Service definition for the migrations proxy that runs
# on a separate TCP port.
[[services]]
  protocol = "tcp"
  internal_port = 65432

  [[services.ports]]
    port = 65432
    handlers = ["pg_tls"]
```

:::info Secrets and environment variables
[Secrets](https://fly.io/docs/reference/secrets/) allow sensitive values, such as credentials, to be passed securely to your Fly app. The secret is encrypted and stored in a vault. It is made available to the app as an environment variable.

We're not using secrets in this example to keep things short and simple. As soon as you're ready to take your Fly app from development to production, make sure to replace the `DATABASE_URL`, `PG_PROXY_PASSWORD` and `AUTH_JWT_KEY` environment variables with secrets.

See also <DocPageLink path="usage/auth/secure"/> to learn about the secure authentication mode for your production-ready deployment of Electric.

### Deploy!

In your terminal, navigate to the directory where `fly.toml` is located and run `fly launch --copy-config --ha=false`:

```text
$ fly launch --copy-config --ha=false
An existing fly.toml file was found for app electric-on-fly-test-app

We're about to launch your app on Fly.io. Here's what you're getting:

```

:::caution
We don't _currently_ support multiple running Electric instances connected to the same database. So it's important to override Fly's default behaviour of creating two machines for a new app by passing the `--ha=false` flag to `fly launch`.
:::

Verify app's status using `fly app list`:

```shell
$ fly app list
NAME                    	OWNER   	STATUS  	PLATFORM	LATEST DEPLOY
electric-on-fly-test-app	personal	deployed	machines	1m5s ago
```

Verify that Electric has successfully initialized its connection to Postres:

```shell
$ curl https://electric-on-fly-test-app.fly.dev/api/status
Connection to Postgres is up!
```


## Deploying Electric connected to Fly Postgres

Follow the [offical Fly Postgres docs](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/) to set up your database. If you already have an instance of Fly Postgres running, make sure it's configured with `wal_level=logical`:

```shell
$ fly pg -a <pg app name> config update --wal-level logical

NAME     	VALUE  	TARGET VALUE	RESTART REQUIRED
wal-level	replica	logical     	true

// highlight-next-line

Please note that some of your changes will require a cluster restart
before they will be applied.

Restarting machine 148ed127a03de8
  Waiting for 148ed127a03de8 to become healthy (started, 1/3)
```

Now go back to [Configure your Fly app](#configure-your-fly-app) above and modify the contents of the `fly.toml` file shown there by changing the `DATABASE_URL` value to use your Fly Postgres instance's connection string and adding the `DATABASE_REQUIRE_SSL` environment variable:


```toml
[env]
  DATABASE_URL = "postgres://postgres:...@<pg-app-name>.flycast:5432"
  DATABASE_REQUIRE_SSL = "false"
  ...the rest of the env vars
```

Fly Postgres does not support encrypted database connections inside its private 6PN network while Electric enforces encryption by default. The above `DATABASE_REQUIRE_SSL` setting changes Electric's behaviour by allowing it to fallback to using unencrypted connections.

## Connecting the client app to Electric running on Fly

If you don't already have an Electric-enabled client app, follow our <DocPageLink path="quickstart" /> guide or clone our [Basic Items](/docs/examples/basic) example app and go through its README. In either case, skip the steps that show how to run Postgres and Electric locally.

Create a file named `.env.local` inside your client app's root directory with the following contents so that [`electric-sql commands`](/docs/api/cli) know how to connect to your instance of Electric sync service running on Fly:

```shell
ELECTRIC_SERVICE=https://electric-on-fly-test-app.fly.dev/

# This should be the same password as the one used
# for PG_PROXY_PASSWORD in your fly.toml
ELECTRIC_PG_PROXY_PASSWORD=proxy_password
```

If you're wondering why we don't set the `ELECTRIC_DATABASE_URL` variable here, that's because client commands only connect to the Migrations proxy which is a component of Electric sync service. Learn more about the Migrations proxy's role and how it fits into the bigger picture in our <DocPageLink path="deployment/concepts#migrations-proxy" /> guide.
