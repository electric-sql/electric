The [Electric sync service](../api/service.md) is usually packaged and run [using Docker](./docker.md). However, under the hood, it's a standard [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) application. See the source code and [Makefile](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/blob/main/components/electric/Makefile) at [electric-sql/electric/components/electric](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/main/components/electric) for more information.

[Let us know on Discord](https://discord.electric-sql.com) if we can help.
