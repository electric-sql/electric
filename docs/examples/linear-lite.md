[Linear](https://linear.app) is a modern project management app, developed on a [local-first architecture](https://linear.app/blog/scaling-the-linear-sync-engine).

This example is based on the excellent [linearapp_clone](https://github.com/tuan3w/linearapp_clone) developed by [Tuan Nguyen](https://github.com/tuan3w), with the data layer swapped out to use Electric. The dataset in the example is seeded with a set of public GitHub issues from the ReactJS project. The data is reset every 24 hours.

## Source code

Clone the monorepo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/electric-sql/electric
```

Change into the `linearlite` example directory:

```shell
cd electric/examples/linearlite
```

Follow the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/blob/main/examples/linearlite/README.md) and see the page here on [running the examples](./notes/running.md).
