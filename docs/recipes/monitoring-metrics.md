Often times mission-critical metrics need to be monitored in real-time to ensure operations are running smoothly. This is often done through polling or streaming aggregated data, resulting in delays and slow queries when you want to drill in to the finer details - e.g. going from a 5 minute period to a 10 second period.

Electric provides a simple way to monitor metrics, with the relevant data synced locally for fast access while retaining real-time updates.
