The algorithm to use for JWT verification. The following algorithms are supported:

- `HS256`, `HS384`, `HS512`: HMAC-based cryptographic signature that relies on the SHA-2 family of hash functions
- `RS256`, `RS384`, `RS512`: RSA-based algorithms for digital signature
- `ES256`, `ES384`, `ES512`: ECC-based algorithms for digital signature
