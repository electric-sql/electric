ElectricSQL replication uses the Satellite protocol over a web socket connection.

This protocol is agnostic to the client and is designed to be used from multiple languages as a standard integration point.

## Definition

## Server

The Electric server implementation is at [electric-sql/electric/components/electric/lib/electric/satellite](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/main/components/electric/lib/electric/satellite).

## Client

The Typescript client implementation is at [electric-sql/electric/clients/typescript/src/satellite](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/main/clients/typescript/src/satellite).
