So far, we've seen how local-first provides [instant reactivity](./local-first.md) and [realtime sync](./multi-user.md). We've looked under the hood at [conflict-free offline](./offline.md), [active-active replication](./active-active.md) and [dynamic sync controls](./sync-controls.md).

Bringing it all together and coming back to a high level, what kind of apps does ElectricSQL really work for? Are there examples and where do you go next?

## Postgres to local-first

ElectricSQL is designed to support relational applications which match a particular pattern. This pattern has a central, Postgres-based, backend application as a control plane or management system. You can then then expose multiple local-first apps and interfaces on top of this, much as you would with traditional API-based architectures.

In this architecture, ElectricSQL replaces traditional APIs and state transfer protocols, like REST and GraphQL. You still define your data model [using your existing web framework](../usage/data-modelling/migrations.md), like Prisma, Phoenix or Rails -- any framework that handles migrations and works with Postgres.

You replace your server-side business logic with a local-first client app and background processing triggered by database events. And you codify your imperative authorization and validation logic into declarative security and sync rules.

## Example applications

You can see this pattern implemented, for example, in our LinearLite application.

LinearLite is a project management SaaS app, based on a simplified clone of Linear.app. It uses a membership-based block sync model where data is segmented by workspace. All users share the same local-first application interface.

<!--

YumDash is a gig-economy, food delivery system that exposes three different local-first apps on top of the same backend management system. The backend management system is for the company that's operating the food delivery service (like a Just Eat or Uber Eats company). There's a local-first app for restaurant owners to manage orders. This is segmented by restaurant (i.e.: membership-based sync). The other two local-first interfaces are for the delivery driver and end-customer. These segment data by a combination of membership-based and location-based sync.
