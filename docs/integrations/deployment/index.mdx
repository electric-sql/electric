ElectricSQL is designed for self-host, i.e.: to be deployed on your infrastructure and hosting platform of choice.

The main component to deploy is the [Electric sync service](../../api/service.mdx). This sits between your local-first apps and [your Postgres database](../../usage/installation/postgres.mdx). It's a horizontally scalable Elixir web service without any special durability requirements, typically packaged [using Docker](./docker.mdx).
