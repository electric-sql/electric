Adapt the SQLite database driver for your target environment.

## How drivers work

ElectricSQL works with existing SQLite database drivers. Connect to your local SQLite database using your existing driver library. Then pass the database `conn` to your driver adapter's `electrify` function when [instantiating your Client](../../usage/data-access/client.mdx#instantiating-the-client).

## Supported drivers

We support the following drivers. If we don't currently support your platform, you can also [implement your own adapter](./drivers/other/generic).
