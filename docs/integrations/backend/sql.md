## Migrations

You can execute DDLX statement using raw SQL.

For example connect using PSQL:

```console
$ psql "<your connection string>"
```

Then execute the statement directly:

```sql
ALTER TABLE items
  ENABLE ELECTRIC;
```

## Event sourcing

There are many ways to consume data changes from Postgres using raw SQL. See <DocPageLink path="integrations/event-sourcing/changes" /> for more information.
