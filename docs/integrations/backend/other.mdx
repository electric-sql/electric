ElectricSQL is designed to work with [any Postgres-backed system](../../usage/installation/postgres.mdx). You don't need a backend framework to use Electric.

## Migrations

You can use any migrations framework that supports executing arbitrary SQL. This includes executing [raw SQL statements](./sql.mdx).

See the other framework examples in this section for pointers.

:::note
If you don't have a data model already and you're looking for a tool to define and manage your Postgres database schema, we recommend [using Prisma](./prisma.mdx).
:::

## Event sourcing

There are lots of ways of consuming and responding to data change events with Postgres. See <DocPageLink path="integrations/event-sourcing" /> for more information.

:::note
If you're looking for a web framework that works well with realtime data processing and event sourcing, we recommend [Phoenix](./phoenix.mdx).
