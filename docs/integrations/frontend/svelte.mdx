### Implementation notes

The [svelte/store](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-store) interface should be useful, for example using [writable](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-store#writable) to store query results. There's a trivial example of a hook-like API [here](https://svelte.dev/repl/7580c4426c1947d8aa3d149a05bdc895?version=4.1.2).

See the [existing React integration](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/main/clients/typescript/src/frameworks/react) for reference / what needs to be ported.
