### Implementation notes

Vue has the [Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables.html). There's also [Provide / Inject](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/provide-inject.html) for the equivalent of context.

See the [existing React integration](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/main/clients/typescript/src/frameworks/react) for reference / what needs to be ported.
