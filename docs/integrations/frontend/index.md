ElectricSQL is designed to integrate with existing reactivity and component frameworks.

This allows you to bind [live queries](../../usage/data-access/queries.md) to component state and hook into data and connectivity change events.

:::caution Work in progress
ElectricSQL currently only has official support for React (both ReactJS and React Native).

If you're interested in helping to develop Solid, Svelte, Vue or any other frontend framework integrations [let us know on Discord](https://discord.electric-sql/com).
