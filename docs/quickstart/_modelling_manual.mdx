ElectricSQL works on top of a standard Postgres data model.

If you have an existing Postgres-backed application, you can use the data model from that. If you need to create or evolve a data model, you can use raw SQL or any Postgres-compatible migrations tooling.

See <DocPageLink path="usage/data-modelling/migrations" /> for more information.
