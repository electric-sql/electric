ElectricSQL is a conflict-free sync layer implementing active-active replication between Postgres in the cloud and SQLite on the local device. As such, it extends Postgres for [strong eventual consistency](../reference/consistency.mdx) and [optimal scale and resiliency](../reference/architecture.mdx).

ElectricSQL is developed by a team of [experienced engineers and specialist distributed database experts](/about/team), under the guidance of:

- [Marc Shapiro](https://lip6.fr/Marc.Shapiro) and [Nuno Preguiça](https://asc.di.fct.unl.pt/~nmp), the co-inventors of [CRDTs](https://crdt.tech)
- [Annette Bieniusa](https://softech.informatik.uni-kl.de/team/annettebieniusa), the lead developer of [AntidoteDB](https://www.antidotedb.eu)
- [José Valim](https://github.com/josevalim), the creator of the Elixir programming language

The project builds on [decades of research](../reference/literature.mdx), in many cases invented and pioneered by the core team and advisors.
