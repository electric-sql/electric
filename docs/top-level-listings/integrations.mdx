ElectricSQL is designed to work as a drop-in solution for existing applications and stacks.

It works with standard open-source Postgres and SQLite. In the frontend, you [adapt the standard SQLite driver](../integrations/drivers/index.mdx) for your target environment and bind live data to your existing [reactivity and component framework](../integrations/frontend/index.mdx).

In the backend, you can use your existing [web framework and migrations tooling](../integrations/backend/index.mdx) to manage content and evolve the database schema. You can self-host with your [existing infrastructure and/or hosting provider](../integrations/deployment/index.mdx) and you can use standard [event sourcing tools](../integrations/event-sourcing/index.mdx) to integrate server-side workflows and background processing.
