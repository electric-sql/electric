## Start a Postgres cluster with a role that does not own the user table
[invoke setup_pg_with_shell_name \

  "-v $(realpath ../scripts/low_privilege_db.sh):/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/initdb-low_privilege_db.sh"]

## Start the sync service
[invoke setup_electric_with_env "ELECTRIC_TWEAKS_SCHEMA_RECONCILER_PERIOD=2s"]

## Verify that the replication pipeline has initialized successfully
[shell electric]

## Create a table and verify that Electric reports an error because it cannot add it to the publication
[invoke start_psql]

[shell psql]
  !CREATE TABLE items(val text);
