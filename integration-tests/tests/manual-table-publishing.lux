## Start a Postgres cluster with a role that does not own the user table
[invoke setup_pg_with_shell_name \
  "pg" \
  "-e LOW_PRIVILEGE_TEST_INIT_SQL='GRANT CREATE ON DATABASE electric TO low_privilege'" \
  "" \
  "-v $(realpath ../scripts/low_privilege_db.sh):/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/initdb-low_privilege_db.sh"]

## Start the sync service
[invoke setup_electric_with_env "ELECTRIC_MANUAL_TABLE_PUBLISHING=true"]

## Verify that the replication pipeline has initialized successfully
[shell electric]
  ??Starting shape replication pipeline
  ??Starting replication from postgres

## Create a table and verify that Electric reports an error because it cannot add it to the publication
[invoke start_psql]

[shell psql]
  !CREATE TABLE items(val text);
  !INSERT INTO items VALUES ('hello');
  ??INSERT 0 1

[shell electric]

## Add the table to the publication and try again
[shell psql]

[shell client]
  [invoke shape_get_snapshot items]

## Wait for the schema reconciler to run and verify that the table is NOT removed from the publication
[shell psql]
  !ALTER TABLE items REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
  ??ALTER TABLE
  ??ALTER TABLE

[shell electric]
  ??[info] Verified publication electric_publication_integration to include ["public.items"] tables with REPLICA IDENTITY FULL
