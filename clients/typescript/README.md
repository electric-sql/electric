# ElectricSQL Typescript Client

[ElectricSQL](https://electric-sql.com) is a local-first sync layer for modern apps. Use it to build reactive, realtime, local-first apps using standard open source Postgres and SQLite.

The ElectricSQL Typescript Client is the main ElectricSQL client library. It provides a type-safe database client autogenerated from your database schema and APIs for [Shape-based sync](https://electric-sql.com/docs/usage/data-access/shapes) and [live queries](https://electric-sql.com/docs/usage/data-access/queries) as well as SQLite driver adapters and frontend framework integrations.

See the:

- [Quickstart](https://electric-sql.com/docs/quickstart)

And see the [Drivers documentation](https://main--wip-electric-sql-docs.netlify.app/docs/integrations/drivers) for information on how to use for web, mobile, and server applications including wa-sqlite, React Native, Expo and NodeJS.
