# ElectricSQL TypeScript Client

[ElectricSQL](https://electric-sql.com) is a local-first sync layer for modern apps. Use it to build reactive, realtime, local-first apps using standard open source Postgres and SQLite.

The ElectricSQL TypeScript Client is the main ElectricSQL client library. It provides a type-safe database client autogenerated from your database schema and APIs for [Shape-based sync](https://electric-sql.com/docs/usage/data-access/shapes) and [live queries](https://electric-sql.com/docs/usage/data-access/queries) as well as SQLite driver adapters and frontend framework integrations.
