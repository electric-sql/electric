## What is Electric?

Sync is the magic ingredient behind fast, modern software. From apps like Figma and Linear to AI agents running on live local data.

Electric is a Postgres sync engine. It solves the hard problems of sync for you, including partial replication, fan-out, and data delivery. So you can build awesome software, without rolling your own sync.

Specifically, Electric is a read-path sync engine for Postgres. It syncs data out of Postgres into ... anything you like. The core sync protocol is based on a low-level [HTTP API](https://electric-sql.com/docs/api/http). This integrates with CDNs for highly-scalable data delivery.

Partial replication is managed using [Shapes](https://electric-sql.com/docs/guides/shapes). Sync can be consumed directly or via [client libraries](https://electric-sql.com/docs/api/clients/typescript) and [framework integrations](https://electric-sql.com/docs/api/integrations/react).

## Getting Started

See the [Quickstart guide](https://electric-sql.com/docs/quickstart) to get up and running. In short, you need to:

1. have a Postgres database with logical replication enabled; and then to
2. run Electric in front of it, connected via `DATABASE_URL`

For example, using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) from the root of this repo:

```sh
docker compose -f .support/docker-compose.yml up
```

You can then use the [HTTP API](https://electric-sql.com/docs/api/http) to sync data from your Postgres. For example, to start syncing the whole `foo` table:

```sh
curl -i 'http://localhost:3000/v1/shape?table=foo&offset=-1'
```

Or use one of the clients or integrations, such as the [`useShape`](https://electric-sql.com/docs/api/integrations/react) React hook:

```jsx
import { useShape } from "@electric-sql/react"

function Component() {
  const { data } = useShape({
    url: `http://localhost:3000/v1/shape`,
    params: {
      table: `foo`,
      where: `title LIKE 'foo%'`,
    },
  })

  return JSON.stringify(data)
}
```

Again, see the [Quickstart](https://electric-sql.com/docs/quickstart) and the [Docs](https://electric-sql.com) for more details.

## HTTP API Docs

The HTTP API is defined in an [OpenAPI spec](https://swagger.io/specification/) in [website/electric-api.yaml](./website/electric-api.yaml).

## Developing Electric

We use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to install Elixir, Erlang, and Node.js. Versions are defined in [.tool-versions](.tool-versions).

### Mac setup

```sh
brew install asdf
asdf plugin-add nodejs elixir erlang
asdf install
```

You'll probably need to fiddle with your bash/zsh/etc rc file to load the right tool into your environment.
