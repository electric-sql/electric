# ElectricSQL

Local-first. Electrified.

You develop local-first apps. We provide the cloud sync. Without changing your database or your code.

## What is ElectricSQL?

ElectricSQL is a local-first SQL system that adds active-active replication and reactive queries to SQLite and Postgres. Use it to make local-first apps that feel instant, work offline and sync via the cloud.
