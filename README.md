# Electric

This is the replication service for [ElectricSQL](https://electric-sql.com).

It's an Elixir application that integrates with Postgres over logical replication and Satellite (ElectricSQL's client-side replication component that works with SQLite) via a web socket interface.

## Pre-reqs

Docker and [Elixir 1.14 compiled with Erlang 24](https://thinkingelixir.com/install-elixir-using-asdf/).

## Usage

See the [Makefile](./Makefile) for usage. Setup using:

```sh
make deps compile
```

Run the dependencies using:

```sh
make start_dev_env
```

Run the tests:

```sh
make tests
```

And then develop using:

```sh
make shell
```

This runs active-active replication with Postgres over logical replication and exposes a protocol buffers API over web sockets on `localhost:5133`.

For example to write some data into one of the Postgres instances:

```sh
docker exec -it -e PGPASSWORD=password electric_db_a_1 psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U electric -d electric
```

There's a second instance, `electric-db_b_1`, if you want to see data being replicated between them.

Note that you can tear down all the containers with:

```sh
make stop_dev_env
```

### Running the release or docker container

The Electric application is configured using environment variables. Everything that doesn't have a default is required to run.

**Authentication**

By default, in dev mode, electric uses insecure authentication. This just
accepts a user id as the authentication token and authorizes the connection as
that user.

Token based authentication requires a signed JWT token with a `user_id` claim,
and a valid issuer.

To turn on token-based authentication in dev mode and when running in
production, set the following environment variables:

- `SATELLITE_AUTH_SIGNING_KEY` - Some random string used as the HMAC signing
  key. Must be at least 32 bytes long.

- `SATELLITE_AUTH_SIGNING_ISS` - The JWT issuer (the `iss` field in the JWT). 

You can generate a valid token using these configuration values by running `mix electric.gen.token`, e.g:

``` shell
$ export SATELLITE_AUTH_SIGNING_KEY=00000000000000000000000000000000 
$ export SATELLITE_AUTH_SIGNING_ISS=my.electric.server
$ mix electric.gen.token my_user my_other_user
```

The generated token(s) must be passed in the `token` field of the `SatAuthReq`
protocol message.

For them to work, you must run the electric server configured with the same
`SATELLITE_AUTH_SIGNING_KEY` and `SATELLITE_AUTH_SIGNING_ISS` set.

## Migrations

When running locally, you can apply migrations directly using `make apply_migration`. First make sure you've [built your migrations](https://electric-sql.com/docs/usage/migrations) in your application folder, then set the `MIGRATIONS_DIR` environment variable to the path to the migrations folder:

```sh
export MIGRATIONS_DIR='../path/to/migrations'
```

Now (re)run the electric service (with the env var set):

```sh
make shell
```

You can now apply named migrations using:

```sh
make apply_migration name=$MIGRATION_NAME
```

Where `MIGRATION_NAME` is the name of a migration folder created using [`electric migrations new`](https://electric-sql.com/docs/usage/migrations#2-schema-evolution), for example:

```sh
make apply_migration name=1666288253_create_items
```

## OSX

Note that if, when running on OSX, you get errors like:

```
could not connect to the publisher: connection to server at \"host.docker.internal\" (192.168.65.2), port 5433 failed
```

You may need to adjust your docker networking or run Electric within docker. To run within Docker, you can build the docker image locally:

```sh
make docker-build
```

And then run with the right env vars, e.g.:

```sh
docker run -it -p "5433:5433" -p "5133:5133" \
    -e "VAXINE_HOST=host.docker.internal"
    -e "ELECTRIC_HOST=host.docker.internal"
    -e "CONNECTORS=pg1=postgresql://electric:password@host.docker.internal:54321/electric;pg2=postgresql://electric:password@host.docker.internal:54322/electric" \
    docker.io/library/electric:local-build
```
